Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer revealed Tuesday she is expecting identical twin girls but will only take "limited time away" from running the Internet giant.

In a blog post, Mayer said she and husband Zack Bogue are excited about the news and that Yahoo's board of directors has been "incredibly supportive and happy."

She said the twins -- "quite a surprise" -- are likely to arrive in December.

"Since my pregnancy has been healthy and uncomplicated and since this is a unique time in Yahoo's transformation, I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout," Mayer wrote.

Yahoo has snapped up dozens of tech startups since the former Google executive signed on as chief three years ago. Mayer is seeking to give new direction to the company, after its Internet search crown was taken by Google.

"Moving forward, there will be a lot to do for both my family and for Yahoo; both will require hard work and thoughtful prioritization," the 40-year-old wrote.

"However, I'm extremely energized by and dedicated to both my family and Yahoo and will do all that is necessary and more to help both thrive."

"The future looks extremely bright on both fronts."

Mayer gave birth to a baby boy in autumn of 2012.

She announced her first pregnancy just after accepting the top Yahoo post, ramping up a lively debate about working mothers.
