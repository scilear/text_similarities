It’s been a week since we learned that Marissa Mayer is expecting identical twin girls in just a few short months.

Who am I kidding? What that sentence should have said is, it’s been a week since we learned Marissa Mayer is planning to take two weeks of maternity leave.

In that week, I’ve heard reactions that run the gamut. There was the 25-year-old new economy editor on LinkedIn who bemoaned the fact that Mayer’s decision“sends a signal to young female professionals that if you want to take more than two weeks off when you have a kid, perhaps the C-suite isn’t for you.”

Then there was the colleague and mother of two who confessed her deep-seated resentment about Mayer’s substantial resources. Mayer made $42 million last year, which does have it’s perks. Remember when she paid to have a nursery built in her office?

As a mother who took almost six months off when my son was born, I get it. I’m a big fan of substantial parental leave policies. And if I decide to have another child, I don’t want to suffer any negative repercussions should I decide to take the maximum time off.

But here’s the thing: I’m not the CEO of Yahoo.

When Mayer took the top job at the struggling Internet giant three years ago, she was tasked with orchestrating a turnaround. That task is far from complete. The company’s stock price has fallen 37 percent this year, and what has been hailed as one of her biggest wins thus far — the proposed tax-free spinoff of Yahoo’s Alibaba shares into a new company — is now in limbo.

But even if the turnaround was going swimmingly and Mayer was universally hailed a corporate miracle worker, her decision would likely be the same.
