Yahoo’s chief executive officer Marissa Mayer is pregnant with twin girls, she announced on the Yahoo-owned Tumblr blog service Monday evening.

Mayer, who has a 2-year-old son with husband Zachary Bogue, is expecting to give birth in December.

She said she plans to spend little time away from work.

“Since my pregnancy has been healthy and uncomplicated, and since this is a unique time in Yahoo’s transformation, I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout,” she said.

According to Mayer, both Yahoo’s board of directors and her executive team are “incredibly supportive and happy” for her and her decision.

Mayer announced her first pregnancy in mid-2012, the same day she was appointed chief executive of Yahoo. She then famously made good on her plan to take “a few weeks” of maternity leave, returning to work full-time only two weeks after giving birth.

Mayer later paid to have a nursery built in her office, while also banning Yahoo employees from telecommuting, a move that critics found contradictory and a step backward for workplace flexibility. Mayer defended the move, saying working from home was “not what’s right for Yahoo what right now.”
