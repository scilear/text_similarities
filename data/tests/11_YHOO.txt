Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer famously took two weeks maternity leave in 2012. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news) , she's having twins and again plans to take 'limited time off'. Claire Cohen examines what that could mean for her - and all working women

So congratulations to Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo CEO who this week announced that she is expecting identical twin girls in December.

Writing on her Tumblr, the 40-year-old said : “Since my pregnancy has been healthy and uncomplicated and since this is a unique time in Yahoo’s transformation, I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout.”

Back in 2012, when she had son Macallister, that “limited time” meant just two weeks.

Mayer found herself at the centre of a heated debate about working mothers, which started when she revealed her pregnancy on the same day as being made Yahoo (Hanover: YHO.HA - news) chief . Her 14-day maternity leave caused many to question her priorities as a parent. Others cast doubt on her dedication to her career.

At the time, Mayer lamented not being able to take the “glorious six-month maternity leave” she’d envisioned before accepting the Yahoo job. But three years in, she clearly feels no need to make full use of the California-based company’s offer of paid leave for 16 weeks for new mothers a perk she introduced after having her first child.

Taking off just a fortnight to look after her new twins, does she know what she’s letting herself in for? And is her decision setting an unhealthy precedent for women at the top?

“I’m afraid she doesn’t know what’s going to hit her,” says Linzi Hildesley, mum to eight-year-old identical twin boys, Rory and Jude.

“Like her, I had a straightforward pregnancy and birth with my first son. But having twins is very different and incredibly difficult to legislate for.”

Although rare, twins are more likely to be born early, according to the NHS website . In the UK, fewer than half of all twin pregnancies go beyond 37 weeks. And more than half of twins are delivered by caesarean, as Linzi’s sons were.

“I was still in hospital after two weeks and my husband had to hold me up in the shower to stop me fainting,” she says. “It’s a big assumption for Mayer to think she’ll be back at her desk. You can’t take anything for granted when it comes to twins.”

And having two babies presents its own set of challenges.

“The first year is basically a black hole,” says Linzi. “When identical twins are born they’re like a little unit that just cries, and needs changing and feeding constantly.

“But as they get older, they start to develop their own personalities. They also developed a little slower than their older brother I’m glad I got to enjoy those milestones. It’s sad to think Mayer might not.”

While most office workers just muddle through, trying to balance the endless juggle that being a working mother brings, Mayer is in a pretty unique position.

She’s one of only four per cent of women who run Fortune 1,000 companies; she earns £27m a year and is married to an investor, Zachary Bogue, and can afford to employ an army of staff, round the clock. During her last pregnancy, she had a nursery built in her office .

The rest of us those with more modest funds have to contend with nurseries often not accepting children below the age of six months. Without a willing family member living nearby, we will have little choice but to shelve the return to work for as long as we can afford.

Indeed, in the UK, it has become the norm for new mothers to take a full year off plus holiday. While last June saw the introduction of shared parental leave .

If the idea of taking a mere fortnight off is unimaginable to British mothers, in the US, they might not be so shocked. Many women in America take just two to three weeks of maternity leave albeit not out of choice.

Unbelievably, it’s one of only two countries out of 185 where statutory leave isn’t a right (the other is Papua New Guinea). According to a Department of Labour review, one in four women in the US returns to work within two weeks of giving birth , while half of all pregnant workers don’t receive any pay after giving birth.

Things are changing, if slowly. Mayer’s announcement comes as US tech companies are hotly debating the issue of parental leave.

Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news) recently upped its paid maternity leave from 12 to 18 weeks, while Netflix (Hanover: NFC.HA - news) now offers a year . IBM (NYSE: IBM - news) has started paying mothers to have their breast milk pumped and shipped home so that they can go on foreign business trips.

There’s a growing acceptance that refusing to support new parents can lead to employee burnout and harm business in the long-term.

It’s worth nothing, though, that even the world’s best countries for maternity leave surprise, surprise, the Nordic nations, where Denmark offers a full year at full pay aren’t working-mum utopia.

While such generous laws have helped get women back to work (in 2010, Sweden had the highest percentage of working women in the world at 87.5 per cent, compared to 75.2 in the US), there are problems. Women in Nordic countries are actually less likely to climb the career ladder than women in the US and, among female executives, the pay gap is wider.

Those who take a year off for every baby can only watch as the glass ceiling hardens above them.

A 2007 review by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development concluded: “Women who make full use of their maternity or parental leave entitlements receive, on average, lower wages in the years following their resumption of work.”

Of course, women can be both mothers and CEOs.

YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki is a mother-of-five; Helena Morrissey, head of Newton Asset Management in the UK, has nine and how many weeks Mayer takes off is entirely up to her.

But I can’t help feeling it might have a wider impact. After all, she’s held up as a role model for ambitious women the world over. If the boss, who has already proved herself by taking one short maternity leave, doesn’t feel like she can leave her desk for more than a few days, what hope for the rest of us?

Helena Morrissey talks about balancing her family and role as CEO:

The implication is that women who use their full allowance are less committed.

“It (Other OTC: ITGL - news) doesn’t set a good example to the rest of the workforce to see their CEO saying that she can’t take time off,” agrees Linzi.

We’re living in a new era of awareness around maternity discrimination, where pregnant women and new mothers are frequently seen as lacking by their male employers. A recent survey of 3,200 women, by the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission, found that around 54,000 mums were being forced out of their jobs each year because of maternity discrimination. More than half of all pregnant women suffer some form of discrimination in the workplace.

It’s testament to a working culture that leaves too little time to dedicate to both family and climbing the career ladder. No wonder we’re not “having it all”.

Joeli Brearley , founder of maternity discrimination campaign Pregnant then Screwed , explains:

“Many women become victims of discrimination from the point they become pregnant and experience pressure to return to work. This has a profoundly negative effect on their confidence to be mothers and continue their careers resulting in large numbers leaving their jobs. The gender pay gap also grows when women become mothers.”

The idea in urging businesses to promote gender equality is not for women to feel they have to act like male bosses. It’s to change workplace culture completely. But until high-profile male figures, especially in the tech world, take paternity leave, the cycle could be hard to break. We’re looking at you, Mark Zuckerberg .

After Mayer’s pregnancy announcement, there was a drop in the Yahoo share price . Is that really the position we want women CEOs to be placed in?

In 1996, Karren Brady (NYSE: BRC - news) took three days’ off from her job as managing director of Birmingham City football club after having her daughter, but has since said she “regrets” not taking longer. Could Mayer end up feeling the same way?

“Few people are truly indispensable in the office, but you can’t get that time with your children back,” says Linzi. “When I had Rory and Jude, I was in a very high pressure job and constantly juggling deadlines but nothing could have prepared me for how intense having twins would be.

“Sometimes you’d much rather be in work when they’re really little it’s an awful lot easier. And when you’ve got an older child, as Mayer has, it’s unbelievable. I was breastfeeding twins and trying to potty train a toddler at the same time.

“I once got up in the morning to find Rory and Jude trying to change each other’s nappies.

"You just can’t imagine what that’s like until it happens.”
