A confidentiality agreement may not be enough to keep staffers from gossiping about their famous tech companies to the press. But should Silicon Valley powerhouses be able to keep employees from talking about company culture?

Former Yahoo employee Cecile Lal admitted in court papers that she leaked information about Marissa Mayer to a journalist who subsequently wrote a book about the Yahoo CEO, according to the San Jose Mercury News, citing documents filed at the San Jose courthouse on July 1.

Lal was a senior director of product management, custom-branded experiences and partner portals before departing from the company last September. The company described her in the suit as a "former rogue employee." Yahoo sued Lal in May for breach of contract and fiduciary duty.

So what’s the damage?

The book

Business Insider writer Nicholas Carlson’s book "Marissa Mayer and the Fight to Save Yahoo!" used dozens of anonymous sources, including Lal, to follow Mayer's first two years as she moved to reshape Yahoo.

Yahoo said in the lawsuit against Lal that the book "caused unnecessary distraction within Yahoo's workforce" and "undermined the conduct of every other Yahoo employee" who honored the confidentiality agreement.

Sensitive internal access

Yahoo accused Lal of giving Carlson information from a password-protected site. Carlson had access to Mayer's comments during all-staff "FYI" meetings that happen each Friday at the company.

Remember that report when Mayer supposedly read a children's book to employees during one FYI meeting? Or when it was leaked that she received angry questions about the employee-review policy that ranked workers on a curve? Those stories were leaked to Carlson via transcripts kept on an intranet site called "Backyard,” accessible to full-time Yahoo employees like Lal, according to the lawsuit.

Settlement

Lal will pay Yahoo an undisclosed sum and will cooperate with the investigation of leaked information, handing over any information she still has in her possession, the report said.

"She's just not going to contest the case," Ronald Cook, Lal’s lawyer, told the Mercury News. "It's a mutually agreed resolution, which also is a mutually agreed decision not to discuss any details." Chilling effect?

Was talking to a reporter about the culture inside Yahoo the same as giving away trade secrets? No, but it will create a chilling effect for others in Silicon Valley who may have considered talking about their workplaces to the press. The recent New York Times story about Amazon working conditions once again demonstrated the importance of opening up discussions about workplace culture. But lawsuits shut those conversations down quickly. "There's a genre of investigative journalism that writes not about governments, but about large corporations or powerful corporations, or corporations of interest for whatever reason," said Peter Scheer, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, per the Mercury News. "It can be hazardous work for journalists and their sources. Reporters or writers are subject to certain special protections under the First Amendment. Confidential sources, quite frankly, are not, and there's a fundamental unfairness in our legal system."
