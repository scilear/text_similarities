NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Volkswagen (VLKAY) stock closed down by 1.58% to $23.72 on Thursday, after the company reported U.S. September sales that were weighed down by the company's admission that it rigged emissions controls in its diesel-powered passenger vehicles.

September sales increased by 0.56% year-over-year to 26,141 vehicles after the company halted sales of 4-cylinder diesel vehicles midway through the month.

A 50.6% increase in sales of Golf models made up for a 24.1% drop in Jetta sales and a 15.5% decline in Beetle sales.

Additionally, Volkswagen's supervisory board hired law firm Jones Day to investigate how about 11 million diesel vehicles were fitted with software that allowed the vehicles to only turn on emissions controls when being officially tested.

The board expects the investigation to take several months.

Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice of violation of the Clean Air Act to the German carmaker for selling vehicles that emitted pollutants at up to 40 times the allowed amount.

The EPA may also seek that the company recall the affected vehicles, Reuters reports.

"EPA will require VW to remedy the noncompliance. It is likely that there will be a recall of affected vehicles," an EPA spokesperson told Reuters.
