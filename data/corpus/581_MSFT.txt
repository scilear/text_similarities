New Delhi, June 1 (IANS) Microsoft on Monday announced its latest operating system - Windows 10 - will be released end-July but did not reveal the price.

The long-awaited version will be available beginning July 29 in 190 markets globally as a free upgrade to customers running on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.

The announcement assumes significance as the release might see Microsoft become a much bigger player within a very small time. The latest operating system not only promises new features like the Edge (a new browser in place of Internet Explorer), but also will support intra-devices connectivity that will help users synchronise settings across all Microsoft devices using a Microsoft account.

Microsoft Edge is the all-new Windows 10 browser built to give users a better web experience as it allows users to write directly on webpages and share mark-ups with others. Users can read online articles free of distraction or use the offline reading feature for greater ease of use.

According to a release, the tech major has used help from more than four million people around the world to create Windows 10 that promises a new era of personal technology, designed to empower people.
