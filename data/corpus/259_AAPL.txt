Apple's latest smartphone launched, the 6s and 6s Plus, but are the new editions worth the cost of upgrading. CNBC's Phil Han captured the mood on the ground.

Scenes of fans camped outside one of London's biggest Apple stores can only mean one thing â€“ a new product from the U.S. tech giant.

The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus go on sale Friday as fans brave the cold to get their hands on the latest handset while investors await to see whether Apple's flagship product still has legs.

Earlier this month, Apple said the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were "on pace to beat last year's 10 million unit first-weekend record" in terms of sales, when the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus went on sale in 2014. But the Cupertino, CA-based tech giant didn't crack out the exact figures it is expecting.

Analysts at FBR Capital Markets noted that there will only be two days of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus sales included in the September quarter which closes on Saturday versus nine days in the previous year. But in the December quarter, the research firm said that Apple is on "a trajectory to exceed Herculean-like YOY (year-on-year) iPhone 6 comps in the December quarter with our estimates now 77 million units (versus our prior 74 million), likely alleviating lingering bear chatter".
