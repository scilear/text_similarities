General Electric (NYSE:GE) signaled it may take on more debt to buy back shares, just a few weeks after Trian Fund Management took a 1% stake and urged such a move, though GE's M&A plans may clash with the activist investor's concerns.

The Fairfield, Conn.-based conglomerate also reported industrial operating earnings rose 16% to 29 cents a share, topping analyst estimates of 26 cents. Industrial segment operating margins jumped 100 basis points to 17.3%.

Revenue fell 22.7% to $27.9 billion, missing views of $28.6 billion, as revenue from the oil and gas unit tumbled 16% to $3.9 billion. But GE's power and water revenue rose 1% to $6.5 billion. Aviation revenue climbed 5% to $6 billion, transportation grew 3% to $1.6 billion, and appliances rose 8% to $2.3 billion.

Industrial backlog rose 5% to $270 billion, while orders tumbled 26% to $23.2 billion.

GE shares closed up 3.4% to 28.98 in the stock market today.

Earlier this month, Trian disclosed a $2.5 billion stake in GE, after acquiring 98.5 million shares. The fund, which is headed by Nelson Peltz, is largely onboard with GE's industrial focused strategy, but said it wants management "to deliver on its commitments."

Trian also wants GE to expand its margins, explore more share buybacks, be disciplined in its acquisitions and mull additional ways to consider scaling back GE Capital.

GE CFO Jeff Bornstein told the Financial Times Friday that the company is open to borrowing money to buy back shares.

Meanwhile, Bornstein told Bloomberg that GE is exploring up to $10 billion in dealmaking in order to boost its newly created digital unit. Whether that fits into Peltz's vision of more disciplined M&A remains to be seen.

The company has heeded the urging of investors as well as its own desire to avoid tougher federal financial regulations. This month, it sold $32 billion worth of assets in commercial lending and leasing to Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). It has $126 billion in total signed deals to date, GE CEO Jeff Immelt said in a statement.

GE also is launching a share exchange to spin off Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), its consumer finance subsidiary, next week. The company plans to return $30 billion to shareholders next year via share buybacks and dividend payouts.

Synchrony shares finished down 3.7% to 30.15 Friday after reporting quarterly results. Wells Fargo shares edged up 0.4% to 52.88.
