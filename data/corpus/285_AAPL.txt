Tech giant Samsung is going after a piece of the mobile payment pie. CNBC's Jon Fortt reports the latest after attending Samsung Pay's launch event.

It only launched a month ago, but Samsung Pay has been used for more than $30 million's worth of transactions in South Korea, as the electronics giant prepares to open the service to U.S. users in a bid to challenge Apple in the mobile payments space.

In the month to September 20, Samsung saw 1.5 million transactions, with 10 percent of people using Samsung Pay daily, the company said on Wednesday.

Samsung Pay is the company's mobile payments system, which allows customers to store their card details in a "mobile wallet" and pay using their smartphone. The service is available on the Galaxy S6, S6 edge, S6 edge+ and Note5 phones, as well as the Gear S2 smartwatchâ€”all devices that Samsung released this year.

The mobile payments space is heating up and Samsung Pay must compete with Apple's platform as well as Google's new Android Pay, which launched in the U.S earlier this month.
