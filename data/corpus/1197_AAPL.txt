The bad blood between Taylor Swift and Apple appears to be officially over. Just months after Swift spoke out against artists not being paid during a free trial period for streaming service Apple Music (convincing Apple to reverse course), the pop star and one of Apple’s top execs will be co-hosting a fashion party together in New York City.

Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is backing the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute exhibition next spring titled, “Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology,” as well as the 2016 Met Gala, which means the tech giant will have a presence at what is easily New York City’s most star-studded fashion event of the year.

The exhibition will focus on the dichotomy between handmade haute couture and machine-made fashion.

Ive, Apple’s chief design officer will host the May 2 soiree alongside Swift, British actor and musician Idris Elba, and Vogue editor Anna Wintour.

“Traditionally, the distinction between the haute couture and prêt-à-porter was based on the handmade and the machine-made,” Andrew Bolton, curator of the Costume Institute, said according to Vogue.“But recently this distinction has become increasingly blurred as both disciplines have embraced the practices and techniques of the other.”

Last year, Yahoo chief Marissa Mayer was co-host of the event, which celebrated the exhibition “China: Through the Looking Glass.” Amazon chief Jeff Bezos was meeter-and-greeter several years ago when his company was introducing Amazon Fashion.

Fashion designers (yes, they’re invited too, of course) Nicolas Ghesquière, Karl Lagerfeld, and Miuccia Prada will serve as honorary chairs.
