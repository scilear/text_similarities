"The possibilities of today's PCs are endless, but millions of people are still using outdated systems," Karen Quintos, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Dell, said in a press release.

"For consumers and business users alike, entirely new benefits and features come standard in the latest devices. Now is the perfect time to experience what you've been missing."

The campaign comes amid a slowdown in the PC market with shipments plunging 10.8 percent year-on-year in the third quarter on this year, according to market research firm IDC.

Microsoft unveiled its new Windows 10 operating system earlier this year and was offering users free upgrades, a reason analysts say was behind the market decline. But there is reason for optimism.

"While PC shipments will be hampered in the short run by the availability of a free upgrade to Windows 10, the improved PC experience across user segments should drive longer-term demand for new PC hardware that is expected help stabilize the market in 2016 and beyond," Jay Chou, research manager at IDC Worldwide PC Tracker, said in a note earlier this month.
