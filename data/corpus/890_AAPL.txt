On September 23, 2015, a jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas found that certain claims of five digital rights management patents asserted by Pendrell Corporation's (NASDAQ: PCO) subsidiary, ContentGuard Holdings, Inc. ("ContentGuard"), against Samsung Electronics and Google Inc. are valid, but that Samsung (OTC: SSNLF) products and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) products accused in the lawsuit do not infringe the asserted patents.

ContentGuard is assessing the jury's findings and evaluating its options to challenge the verdict.

ContentGuard's claims against Samsung and Google are part of a larger lawsuit filed by ContentGuard against several companies that have not paid for a license to use ContentGuard's patented digital rights management solutions, including Apple, DirecTV, HTC, Huawei and Motorola Mobility.

The jury verdict does not impact ContentGuard's August 2015 settlement and license agreement with Amazon.com; nor does ContentGuard believe the jury verdict will impact or delay ContentGuard's upcoming November trial against Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).

The asserted patents are United States Patents 6,963,859; 7,523,072; 8,001,053; 8,370,956; and 8,393,007.
