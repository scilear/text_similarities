NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) stock is rising by 0.22% to $111.85 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, after the company announced a new lineup of iMac computers with display and processor updates.

The Cupertino, CA company introduced a 21.5-inch iMac with Retina 4K display and 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display.

The 27-inch iMac will also have a sixth-generation Intel (INTC) Core processor and the latest Advance Micro Devices (AMD) graphics, while the 21.5-inch iMac will include a fifth-generation Intel Core processor and Intel Iris Pro Graphics.

Both models will have two Thunderbolt 2 and an option to include Fusion Drive, which combines the hard drive storage with flash storage.

Apple also updated its lineup of wireless accessories with the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2.

Additionally, the U.S. Justice Department has decided that a court-appointed monitor is no longer needed at Apple, Reuters reports.

Apple was appointed a monitor after it was found liable for conspiring to increase prices of e-books, but the monitor has found that the company has changed its antitrust compliance program.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook.
