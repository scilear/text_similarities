NEW YORK (TheStreet) --General Electric Co. (GE - Get Report) stock is down by 0.76% to $27.56 in mid-morning trading on Thursday, as the S&P cut its outlook on the company's credit rating to "negative" from "stable."

The S&P's decision comes after activist investor Nelson Peltz purchased a $2.5 billion stake in the multinational conglomerate, Reuters reports.

Peltz's Train Fund Management disclosed on Monday that it has taken about a 1% stake in GE and has urged the company to look into more share buybacks and even taking on more debt.

Train is advocating share buybacks "beyond our current expectations," S&P said in a report, Reuters noted.

S&P's "negative" outlook means it could downgrade GE's credit rating in the next two years.

"The negative outlook reflects our expectation that the company could potentially adopt a less conservative financial policy than we currently expect," S&P said, Reuters added.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates GENERAL ELECTRIC CO as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (GE) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, good cash flow from operations, expanding profit margins and solid stock price performance. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat weak growth in earnings per share.
