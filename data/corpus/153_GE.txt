Stocks remained higher in late-afternoon trading Wednesday in a rally that saw a few high-rated stocks break out past buy points. The Nasdaq led with a 1.9% increase, while the S&P 500 added 1.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 1.1%. Volume was tracking slightly lower.

A few high-rated stocks broke out of bases in the stock market today, including a couple of financials.

Euronet Worldwide (NASDAQ:EEFT) made a decisive move above a 71.60 buy point. The provider of electronic financial transactions is thinly traded, yet has a valuation of nearly $4 billion.

Universal Insurance (NYSE:UVE) broke out of a cup-with-handle base in active trading.

Infosys (NYSE:INFY) rallied 5% to clear the 18.33 buy point of a choppy cup-with-handle. The India-based IT outsourcing and consulting firm announced Wednesday that it is teaming up with General Electric (NYSE:GE) to develop Internet-of-Things products for industrial use. GE shares were up 2%.

Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) gapped up, topping the 192.37 buy point of a seven-week pattern in heavy trading. An activist investor fund has acquired a stake in the company.

Woes continued for apparel retailerGap (NYSE:GPS). Shares gapped to a three-year low. Stefan Larsson, who heads Gap's Old Navy division and was considered one of its best executives, is leaving to take over as CEO of Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL). Shares of Ralph Lauren — which announced late Tuesday that its namesake CEO was stepping down as CEO but staying on as chairman — shot up 13%.

Beaten-up medical stocks were among the best-performing. Energy, semiconductor and other technology stocks also led.
