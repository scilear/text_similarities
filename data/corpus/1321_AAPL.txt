NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) shares were trading in the lower $130 area ahead of the company's last quarterly earnings report in late July. The news caused the stock to make a big gap down and created a directional move lower for the better part of the following six weeks. Negative news about China also affected the the stock to some degree.

Starting around the beginning of September, the stock showed some stabilization and is currently range bound, locked in the $108-$115 region as seen on our daily chart below:

We were negative on the stock after earnings last quarter but are turning more neutral on the stock given how the stock has been acting technically of late. Although the market has firmed and the S&P 500 is currently above both 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages, Apple is still below them, so it has been lagging the broad market to some degree after the market bottomed out in September.

In order to become more bullish on the stock, we'd need to see a breakout from its current range on volume that is at least 1.5 times the daily average. This would put short-sellers on edge. Then we'd like to see a successful test of the breakout region and 50-day exponential moving average support area. The market has been more favorable the past few weeks, so it's possible Apple could make a move ahead of earnings.

Its also possible that the stock sees its next directional move after earnings on Oct. 27, which could set the tone for the following three months. For now, The Informed Trader remains focused in other areas.
