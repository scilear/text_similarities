If there's one thing that can bring together disruptive entrepreneurs at Box and old-line engineers Apple, it's mobility for enterprise tools, Aaron Levie said Tuesday.

"What Apple has done is enabled every individual to have a tablet and a phone that needs to be able to connect to new information from many different platforms," Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box, told CNBC's "Power Lunch." "Our growth at Box has been driven by the push to mobility, which has been core to what Apple has done over the past five years."



Box, a start-up that focuses on cybersecurity and cloud computing for businesses, is in the midst of BoxWorks, a star-studded annual customer conference in San Francisco. Levie sat down with Apple CEO Tim Cook at Tuesday's BoxWorks session, where they discussed Apple's move into enterprise, including a partnership with Box.
