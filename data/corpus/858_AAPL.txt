Apple's new spaceship campus won't be finished for a little while, but we're already getting an idea of what the finished project will look like. A recently published video captured via drone shows how construction has progressed over the past month or so.

Here's a look at the main building.

You'll notice the ring is closer to being completed in the photo above than in the one below, which was taken from a drone video published on Sept. 1.

The video, which was published by YouTube channel Myithz, contains footage that shows construction between September and October.

The futuristic new campus was one of the last projects Steve Jobs presented publicly. It's estimated to be completed towards the end of 2016, according to Cupertino.org, and it's going to be incredibly energy efficient. There will be 700,000 square feet of solar panels installed.
