Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk says Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) isn't a serious electric threat, telling German newspaper Handelsblatt that Apple hires from Tesla are failures.

"They have hired people we've fired," Musk said. "We always jokingly call Apple the 'Tesla Graveyard.' If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I'm not kidding."

Musk conceded that a "car is the next logical thing" for Apple, but says that iPhones and the Apple Watch are not nearly as complex as an automobile.

While Musk says Apple is a threat, his story has changed. As recently as May, Tesla said it hadn't lost any engineers to Apple.

Analysts have turned negative — or at least less bullish — on Tesla's stock in recent days. A common refrain is that the Model X price is too high. But some also have noted that Apple could be a serious rival to Tesla for cool tech factor.

Tesla shares fell 2.3% on the stock market Wednesday, closing back below the 200-day moving average. Tesla is the lowest-rated auto stock on two key quality measures, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating and earnings per share rating, below General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY).
