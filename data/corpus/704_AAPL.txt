Apple's mobile devices are never going to get Android Pay, but Google has released its repurposed Wallet app for iOS anyway. Just like its Android counterpart, the app is now decked in green (with the new logo!) and focuses on person-to-person payments. If you've never used it before, note that you can use Wallet to split tabs with friends, send and receive payments, which you can then cash out to a debit card. It doesn't look like Mountain View listed it as a separate download on iTunes like it did on Google Play, so you can just update your old app to get the new one.
