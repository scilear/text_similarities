BALTIMORE (Stockpickr) â€“ Wall Street's bet that the Fed wouldn't hike interest rates appears to have paid off -- sort of. While the guess that Janet Yellen and company weren't going to vote to raise interest rates turned out to be correct, the big S&P 500 index still sold off about 2% following the rate decision from the Fed.

Despite that drop in stocks catching investors by surprise, the fact that interest rates are being held steady does create some upside opportunities in the big-name stocks. To grab on to the stocks likely to see upside this week, we're taking a look at five Rocket Stocks worth buying after the Fed decision.

For the uninitiated, "Rocket Stocks" are our list of companies with short-term gain catalysts and longer-term growth potential. To find them, I run a weekly quantitative screen that seeks out stocks with a combination of analyst upgrades and positive earnings surprises to identify rising analyst expectations, a bullish signal for stocks in any market. After all, where analysts' expectations are increasing, institutional cash often follows. In the last 316 weeks, our weekly list of five plays has outperformed the S&P 500's record run by 77.9%.

Without further ado, here's a look at this week's Rocket Stocks.
