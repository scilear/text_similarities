Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) came out ahead of fourth-quarter expectations as sales volume climbed 17%, and the lighting-fixture company said it is "bullish" on its growth prospects.

Earnings grew 29% to $1.63 a share, a penny above views. Revenue climbed almost 14% to $759.5 million, topping forecasts for $754.9 million. Sales grew across most product categories and geographies, and LED-based lighting accounted for more than half of total Q4 net sales, said Acuity.

Shares rose 3.4% to 182.42 in the stock market today.

"We remain very bullish about our prospects for future profitable growth," CEO Vernon Nagel said in a statement. "Third-party forecasts, as well as key leading indicators, suggest that the growth rate for the North American lighting market, which includes renovation and retrofit activity, will be in the mid to upper single-digit range for fiscal 2016, with expectations that overall demand in our end markets will continue to experience solid growth over the next several years."

Management expects that the acquisition of Distech Controls — completed in September — will be "modestly accretive" to the company in fiscal 2016.

Cheaper LED products from the likes of General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Philips (NYSE:PHG) have been beneficial to Acuity. Conversely, the trend has weighed on LED light bulb maker Cree (NASDAQ:CREE), which announced in June that it would restructure its LED business to reflect overcapacity and downtrending prices.

Cree shares rose 1.4% to 25.52.
