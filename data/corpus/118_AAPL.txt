Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, citing iPhone market-share gains in China, and said wireless firms Verizon Communications and T-Mobile will likely get a boost from iPhone demand.

Analyst Katy Huberty raised her price target on Apple to 162 from 155. Apple stock was flat in midday trading in the stock market today, near 112.

Based on a consumer survey, Morgan Stanley said global smartphone sales remain strong despite weakening economies in emerging markets.

In China, Huberty says, Samsung has been losing share.

"Apple and Huawei are share gainers, with Apple strong among higher-income (consumers) and Chinese brands stronger among lower-income consumers," Huberty wrote.

In the U.S., "Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NYSE:TMUS) are best positioned for postpaid subscriber growth in the next six months," Huberty said. "We view T-Mobile as the best positioned to increase its share of iPhone subscribers, while AT&T (NYSE:T) has the most exposure to the iPhone."

Apple recently rolled out its own leasing plan for wireless customers. Apple might comment on consumer uptake when it reports September-quarter earnings on Oct. 27.

"Sixty percent of U.S. iPhone owners plan to upgrade their device in the next 12 months, compared to 47% in our December survey," Huberty said. "The upgrade cycle is even more robust in China, where 74% of iPhone owners plan to upgrade their device in the next year."
