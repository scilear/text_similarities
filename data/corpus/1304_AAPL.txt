NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) shares are increasing 1.78% to $111.45 on Friday afternoon as the tech giant's mobile payment and digital wallet service, Apple Pay, is expanding.

Starting next year, Apple Pay will be available in Starbucks (SBUX), Yum! Brands' (YUM) KFC and Brinker International's (EAT) Chili's, according to Re/code.net.

This means that consumers can pay using their Apple Watch or iPhone.

Cupertino, CA-based Apple first launched Apple Pay back in October 2014 and since then the company has been adding more merchants, including Best Buy (BBY), where Apple Pay went live yesterday in 1,400 stores, The Verge reports.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results.
