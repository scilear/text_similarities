As rumored, Microsoft has slated its big-bang Windows 10 hardware launch for October 6 in New York City.

Microsoft sent invitations to press and analysts for the upcoming event, which will be held at Skylight at Moynihan Station, near the former Farley Post Office across from Penn Station. (That Fifth Avenue New York City flagship Microsoft Store, unsurprisingly, isn't quite ready yet, it seems.)

While the invitations don't detail which new products Microsoft will unveil at the launch, tipsters have said Surface Pro 4, Band 2 and the new "Cityman" and "Talkman" premium Lumia phones (expected to be christened Lumia 950 and 950 XL) will be the stars of the Microsoft hardware show.

I doubt any of the new Microsoft hardware will be available on October 6. I've heard from some contacts that the Surface Pro 4 tablets are likely to ship some time in November, still in time for the holiday season. I'd expect the Lumia phones and Bands also to be out in time for holiday.

While information, including the likely specs, of the new Lumia premium phones have leaked, little has leaked about the Surface Pro 4 and/or new Microsoft fitness band.

Some of us have been hearing Surface Pro 4 will be a faster, thinner and lighter update to the Surface Pro 3. It will basically be the same form factor, with a smaller bezel, making the screen feel larger, one of my contacts told me recently. We're all expecting Intel's new Skylake processors to be what's inside. Hopefully we'll also see some improvements to the Type keyboard and a way to use the existing Surface Pro docks with the new devices.

I've heard Microsoft's Band 2.0 device won't be running any kind of variant of Windows 10 inside (it will still be firmware-based, sources say), but it will be part of the Windows 10 family of new hardware products, sources have said.

Update: Microsoft will be live streaming the October 6 hardware event, a company spokesperson confirmed when I asked. URL to come closer to the event date.
