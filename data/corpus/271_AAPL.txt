Ross Gerber, Gerber Kawasaki CEO, Dan Ives, FBR Capital markets, weigh in on what the future of GoPro will look like.

Apple should take the opportunity to acquire GoPro now, said Ross Gerber, CEO and president of Gerber Kawasaki, on Wednesday.

"GoPro has a unique position in the market and they should be bought by Apple," he told CNBC's "Closing Bell." "A small position in GoPro is a risky investment for many investors but if you are thinking long-term and you're a growth investor, I think this is finally the entry point we've been waiting for."



Shares of the action camera maker hit an all-time low on Wednesday, on negative reviews of its new product line, as well as off a bearish analyst note which about halved the price target.

Gerber said the cheap price is an opportunity for Apple to get another bright ecosystem addition.
