Jack Welch, Jack Welch Management Institute, shares his opinions on Donald Trump, and Carly Fiorina, in the presidential race.

Former General Electric chief Jack Welch said Thursday he plans to vote for the Republican who he thinks can win the presidency.

While refusing to commit to any candidate at this point, Welch said GOP frontrunner and billionaire businessman Donald Trump has touched a nerve. "He's saying things that a lot of us would like to say."

Trump is looking more serious day by day, but "is he a winner? I don't know," Welch said, because it's "too early" to tell.

One thing is for sure, according to Welch, "He has rallied Republicans. Look at the ratings. He's made it more interesting."

The Trump factor in last week's debate gave CNN a network-record 23.1 million viewers. Fox drew an audience of 24 million last month. CNBC sponsors the next Republican debate on Oct. 28.

"More people are looking. More people are evaluating [Trump] and the other candidates," Welch saidâ€”adding rising GOP candidate Carly Fiorina, a former CEO at Hewlett-Packard, has been the biggest surprise.
