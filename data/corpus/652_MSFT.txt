A long-running patent feud between Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news) and Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news) is over after the tech giants struck a deal.

Some 18 lawsuits between the companies had been active, relating to Wi-Fi, mobile phones and other technology.

But the firms say they will now "collaborate on certain patent matters" and the legal action is now over.

A joint statement from the companies said: "Microsoft and Google are pleased to announce an agreement on patent issues.

"As part of the agreement, the companies will dismiss all pending patent infringement litigation between them, including cases related to Motorola Mobility.

"Separately, Google and Microsoft have agreed to collaborate on certain patent matters and anticipate working together in other areas in the future to benefit our customers."

The disagreements between the two companies flared up in 2011 when Google bought Motorola Mobility.

As a result, it gained lots of mobile phone and network technology patents.

It (Other OTC: ITGL - news) later sold the company to Lenovo but kept the patents.

Microsoft has adopted a different tone under the leadership of new chief executive Satya Nadella.

When Sundar Pichai was appointed chief executive of Google, Mr Nadella tweeted congratulations to him saying the promotion was "well deserved".
