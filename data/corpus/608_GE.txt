NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Two conglomerates and a big regional bank will be reporting earnings Friday.

General Electric (GE - Get Report) , Honeywell International (HON - Get Report) and SunTrust Banks (STI - Get Report) report before the market opens. The one to watch is General Electric.

Analysts expect third-quarter earnings of 26 cents a share on around $28.5 billion in revenue. Even though its top and bottom line are expected to drop year over year, GE has shown some positive progress. The industrial conglomerate is working to shed its finance arm, GE Capital, and focus more on its core industrial business like power, aviation and health care.

Recently, the company sold an enormous chunk of its financial arm to Wells Fargo (WFC - Get Report) . This is worth about $32 billion, or two-thrids of its total assets it plans to sell. In other news, GE has been working to ease investor concerns about the slumping oil prices and its impact on the company's oil and gas business.
