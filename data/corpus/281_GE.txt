Q: Is GE finally a buy again?

A: General Electric continues to get out of the banking business. It's a painful transition, but one investors are hoping will pay off soon.

The most tangible signpost yet in GE's move from finance and back to its industrial roots came this week after the company won the OK from European and federal officials for the Alstom deal. GE earlier this year made a $9.5 billion play to buy the power business of French multinational Alstrom. Shares of GE jumped 4% Tuesday after the European Commission blessed the deal and the Department of Justice allowed it to go forward. GE continues to shed finance assets. This year the company struck a deal to sell a good chunk of banking businesses.

What investors want to see - is growth - coming out of the restructuring. Revenue this year is expected to fall roughly 15% as the changes are made. However, analysts are calling for GE to put up 3.6% revenue growth in 2016. The expected return of growth is one reason analysts remain bullish on the stock, saying it could be worth 23% more in 18 months than it is now. Shares closed Wednesday at $24.55. But this is far from a done deal. New Constructs still sees GE stock as dangerous as its expected future cash flows still don't justify the current price.
