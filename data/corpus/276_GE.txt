Moody's complete rating action is as follows: Issuer: Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust, Series 2015-4 $275,000,000 Class A Notes, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf) $26,369,863 Class B Notes, Assigned (P)Aa2 (sf) $22,602,739 Class C Notes, Assigned (P)A2 (sf) RATINGS RATIONALE The ratings are based on the counterparty risk assessment (CR Assessment), private monitored rating or low volatility credit estimate, as applicable, of the sponsor, which we use to assess the likelihood of the sponsor becoming insolvent and shutting down its credit card portfolio, the quality of the underlying credit card receivables, the transaction's structural protections, the expertise of General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC) (A1 stable/P-1), as servicer, the credit enhancement from subordinate classes of notes in the series and the Excess Collateral Amount. The sponsor is currently approximately 85% indirectly owned by GECC, but GECC expects to exit from its remaining ownership in the sponsor by the end of 2015. As a result, our stress assumptions used to rate the notes reflect GECC's expectation to exit from its ownership of the sponsor. The Class A Notes comprise 73% of the total collateral amount of the series, the Class B Notes 7% of the total, the Class C Notes 6% of the total and the Class D Notes 9% of the total. The Excess Collateral Amount comprises 5% of the total. The Class A Notes, Class B Notes and Class C Notes have fixed rate coupons. These notes have an expected maturity date of 15 September 2020 and a legal maturity date of 15 September 2023. Moody's ratings address the likelihood of interest payments being made when due and the return of principal by the legal maturity date. Assets of the trust consist of private label and co-branded credit card receivables generated on accounts originated and underwritten by Synchrony Bank. Retailers that are currently included in the trust portfolio are, among others, JCPenney, Lowe's, Sam's Club, Wal-Mart, Gap, Belk and Chevron. Moody's expects performance in the range of 5.5% - 7.5% for charge-offs, 26.0% - 29.0% for yield and 12.5% - 14.5% for the principal payment rate. Moody's performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. From time to time, Moody's may, if warranted, change these expectations. Performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had anticipated when the related securities were rated. Even so, a deviation from the expected range will not necessarily result in a rating action nor does performance within expectations preclude such actions. The decision to take (or not take) a rating action is dependent on an assessment of a range of factors including, but not exclusively, the performance metrics. Methodology Underlying the Rating Action: The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Moody's Approach to Rating Credit Card Receivables-Backed Securities" published in June 2015. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology. Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating: Up Moody's could upgrade the ratings of the securities if our expectation of the trust's performance following a sponsor default and portfolio shutdown (i.e., Aaa LGSD) improves materially, specifically, if the charge-off rate falls or the payment rate or yield rises. A decrease in Moody's assessment of the likelihood of the sponsor shutting down its credit card portfolio, generally reflected from an upgrade to the sponsor's CR Assessment, private monitored rating or low volatility credit estimate, as applicable, could also lead to an upgrade to the rating of the securities, because we use it to assess the likelihood of defaulting and shutting down its credit card portfolio. Down Moody's could downgrade the ratings of the securities if our expectation of the trust's performance following a sponsor default and portfolio shutdown (i.e., Aaa LGSD) deteriorates materially, specifically, if the charge-off rate rises or the payment rate or yield falls. An increase in Moody's assessment of the likelihood of the sponsor shutting down its credit card portfolio, generally reflected from a downgrade to the sponsor's CR Assessment, private monitored rating or low volatility credit estimate, as applicable, could also lead to a downgrade to the rating of the securities, because we use the rating of the sponsor to assess the likelihood of defaulting and shutting down its credit card portfolio. Loss and Cash Flow Analysis: In rating this transaction, Moody's uses a cash flow model to determine the collateral losses in a maximum stress scenario. As a second step, Moody's haircuts such collateral losses based on the sponsor's credit quality. Finally, Moody's compares note available credit enhancement with the adjusted collateral losses, taking into account loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument.

Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF417743 Moody's describes its loss and cash flow analysis in the section "Ratings Rationale" of this press release. Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's rating practices.

For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would have affected the rating.
