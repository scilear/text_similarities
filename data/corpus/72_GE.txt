General Electric (NYSE:GE) reached a major milestone in its efforts to scale down GE Capital by selling its $30 billion commercial lending and leasing unit to Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).

It's GE Capital's largest transaction to date and is expected to close during the first quarter of 2016. The portfolio of leases and loans is worth $32 billion in assets and comprises about 3,000 employees, General Electric said. The deal's other terms weren't disclosed.

So far, the GE unit's total announced deals to reduce its operations total $126 billion, GE said.

The Fairfield, Conn.-based company says that it's more than halfway into the process of selling off $260 billion in finance assets.

GE apparently got the memo from its investors, who had long complained about the industrial conglomerate's decision to go full throttle into financial services. A slimmed-down GE Capital may let General Electric avoid higher capital reserve requirements. The company is scheduled to release third-quarter earnings on Friday.

Shares closed down 0.8% in the stock market today. GE stock vaulted over several sessions to a 17-month closing high on Monday.

Wells Fargo, which has grown revenue in the low single-digit range for the last four quarters, has sought to boost revenue via acquisitions. Its shares fell 0.6%. The San Francisco-based bank is scheduled to report Q3 earnings Wednesday before markets open.
