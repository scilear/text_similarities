NEW YORK (Real Money) -- Can we stop doubting the Chinese consumer already? We have let the weaker auto sales cloud our judgment about what's selling and what's not.

I say that because last night's Nike (NKE - Get Report) call made everyone who has been second-guessing those saying anything good about China look like total dopes. Listen to what Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike Brand, had to say: "In greater China, revenue was up an amazing 30%. Tremendous growth that again proves more than ever the success of our strategies." He went on to say: "These gains were driven by strong performance across nearly all key categories, including sportswear, running and basketball. For our wholesale partners like Bai Li, the doors that have been rep-profiled continued to outperform the rest of the fleet, driving expanded productivity and profitability. We also saw strong growth from our direct-to-consumer business driving by comparable store increases and an acceleration in our e-commerce business."

In other words, China's the strongest market for Nike in the world. It's only going to get better when Michael Jordan, a hero in China, goes to Shanghai next month to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Air Jordan franchise. The company said it expects the "incredible" growth to continue for many years to come.

Let me ask you a question: Do you really need another pair of Jordans? How strapped can this nation of 1.3 billion consumers be if China's leading Nike sales, which are much stronger than they are in the United States?

Now I know there was tremendous skepticism about Apple (AAPL - Get Report) iPhone sales in China until CEO Tim Cook emailed me to tell me about the acceleration of business and how strong it's been. Again, we are talking about the fastest growth of any region.
