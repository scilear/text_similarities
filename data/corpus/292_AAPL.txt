A new film based on the late Apple CEO will be released in early October and offers an inside look at Steve Jobs' personal life.

As Danny Boyle's latest creation, "Steve Jobs" is to hit cinemas this Fall, it's already stirring up controversy thanks to Jobs' successor, Apple's current CEO, Tim Cook.

Aaron Sorkin, screenwriter for "Steve Jobs" has been in the line of fire over the weekend, after retaliating to comments made by the CEO on The Late Show, that filmmakers creating movies on Jobs, were "opportunistic."

In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Sorkin said while the film was "not opportunistic," he hoped Cook would enjoy the film.

"(The film is) not opportunistic. Tim Cook hasn't seen the film yet, or hadn't when he made that comment on Colbert. Nobody signed up for this movie to get rich; it's just not that kind of movie. So I hope that when Tim Cook sees it, he enjoys it as much as I enjoy his products."
