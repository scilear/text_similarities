NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) can finally turn the page on its e-book antitrust case, following a ruling by the Justice Department that court monitoring is no longer necessary as the company has implemented the required policies, procedures and training programs.

The decision to let Apple off the hook was not a straightforward one. There had been reports that the company's relationship with its monitoring official had been"'challenging," and that Apple "never embraced a cooperative relationship with the monitor." However, it was determined that Apple has now complied with antitrust regulations.

Back in 2013, the tech giant was accused of anti-competitive practices for its attempts to fix the prices of e-books at higher rates. The company was found guilty of scheming with five global book publishers to push up the prices of e-books. Apple's counterargument was that aggressive action was needed in order for it to take on Amazon's (AMZN - Get Report) virtual monopoly in the e-book market, and therefore, its behavior was pro-competitive. But that argument did not persuade the court, which ruled that Apple had "played a central role" in the price-fixing negotiations with major publishers.

The company is still considering whether to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. If it doesn't, Apple will have to pay asettlement of $450 million.

Rowling's Harry Potter series. The exclusive e-books will contain over 200 digital illustrations and will retail for $10 each. New markets are also top of Apple's digital publishing priority list; the iPhone maker will soon be launching its iBook service in China alongside iTunes movies and Apple Music.
