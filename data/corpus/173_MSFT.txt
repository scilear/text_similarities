If cash is king, then Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) wears the crown. Among companies in the S&P 500, Microsoft had the most cash and short-term marketable securities at the end of Q2, to the tune of $96.5 billion. That's up 12.6% from Q2 2014, reports FactSet.

General Electric (NYSE:GE) is close behind Microsoft at $91.7 billion, followed by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and then Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at No. 5, according to FactSet.

Cash and short-term investments among all companies in the S&P 500 is near a record high of $1.43 trillion, up 5.5% from Q2 2014 ex financials.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), often cited as having the largest cash hoard, is No. 6 on the list at $32.7 billion. Why so low? FactSet does not include long-term marketable securities, and Apple has $168 billion in that category.

Marketable securities consist generally of common stock, government bonds, certificates of deposits and other securities that can be converted to cash. Short-term securities can be converted into cash within a year. Long-term securities have a longer time horizon.

The information technology sector in the S&P 500 had the largest cash balance of all sectors, at $546.3 billion. Tech has usually led over the past 10 years. Tech companies account for half of the top 10 companies with the most cash, with the five combined at $315 billion.

Oracle had the fastest growth in cash accumulation among the top 10, up 40% from Q2 2014. Cisco was up 16% and Google up 14%.

Apple showed a drop of 8%. One reason: Apple is aggressively returning money to shareholders. It spent about $10 billion on stock buybacks in calendar Q2 and another $3 billion in dividend payouts. This amount was almost double the total of the next-highest company, Microsoft.
