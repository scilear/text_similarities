Biting into Apple: The New Apple TV

Apple unveils its new Apple TV

On September 9, 2015, Apple (AAPL) gave a preview of its new Apple TV at an Apple media event in San Francisco. The new Apple TV is expected to go on sale by the end of October. Apple devices are playing an important role in TV Everywhere growth. TV Everywhere allows cable network users to access content online.

According to the Adobe (ADBE) Digital Index 2Q015 Digital Video Report, the penetration of TV Everywhere into households had a slight decline quarter-over-quarter. It came down from 13.2% in 1Q15 to 12.7% in 2Q15. However, the penetration of TV Everywhere had a significant 19% growth year-over-year from 10.7% in 2Q14 to 12.7% in 2Q15.

The same Adobe Digital Index Report indicates that Apple devices are driving a large part of this TV Everywhere growth. As the above chart indicates, Apple devices including iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV occupied first, second, and third positions, respectively, for devices used in streaming online video for the TV Everywhere service. Googleâ€™s (GOOG) Android-based devices took a distant fourth place.

What is new about the Apple TV?

Apple intends to take the popularity of its devices for TV Everywhere a step further with the new Apple TV. It has made some significant changes to the new Apple TV with a new remote, a new tvOS, and its renewed focus on games. We will explore these features in detail later in this series.
