Microsoft has already done a not-so-stellar job of keeping its upcoming Lumia 950 and 950 XL smartphones a secret, and it just erased whatever doubt was left. The company's UK online store briefly listed both of the unannounced Windows 10 flagships, confirming some of the devices' juiciest specs. As suspected, both Lumias will have Quad HD displays, 20-megapixel cameras and 32GB of expandable storage. The biggest difference is, as you might have gathered, the display sizes: the standard 950 will have a mid-sized 5.2-inch screen, while the XL bumps that up to 5.7 inches. The pricing was conspicuously absent (not surprising given the accidental listings), but there's a real chance that you'll get the full scoop on both handsets at Microsoft's event next week.
