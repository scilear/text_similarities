Not to be totally upstaged by last week’s iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch announcements, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) launched a handful of new hardware products for its Amazon Fire brand. A new 7-inch Fire tablet for $50, a new Fire TV box for $100, a Fire Stick with voice remote for $50 and a Fire Kids Edition tablet for $100. The only thing missing, alas, was another Fire phone, a product that Amazon abandoned earlier this month.

The new $50 tablet is no surprise, nor are the upgrades to two of the larger tablets. What may be a slight surprise is that Amazon did not update its high-end 8.9-inch tablet. That appears to many observers to be a further admission that the high-end of consumer electronics devices belongs to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and competitors stray onto that playing field at their peril.

The Fire TV now supports 4K video and the voice remote. Combined the two products cost about $100, well below the $150 price tag for the base model of the new Apple TV device. Amazon also still offers its Fire Stick with standard remote for $40.

The company also added a gaming edition to its Fire TV lineup. The gaming edition includes a game controller, a Fire TV box, a 32GB microSD card and two free games for $140.

Amazon may be able to gain some traction in the gaming sector, even though it is populated with long-time players like Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. It won’t be easy, but chasing Apple at the high-end is a proven loser. Just ask Samsung.
