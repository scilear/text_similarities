Patients classified as Child-Pugh C will remain contraindicated as they have been since approval.

The updated USPI for VIEKIRA PAK also includes a recommendation for physicians to assess evidence of hepatic decompensation prior to treatment and during treatment in cirrhotic patients.

Because post-marketing events are reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between treatment and these events has not been established.

VIEKIRA PAK with and without ribavirin (:RBV) remains indicated for genotype 1 (GT1) HCV patients with compensated cirrhosis, including Child-Pugh A. The safety and efficacy of VIEKIRA PAK, with and without RBV, has been studied in Phase 3 trials in more than 2,300 patients and is one of the recommended regimens in the AASLD guidelines for these patients. TECHNIVIE in combination with RBV is indicated for genotype 4 (GT4) HCV patients without cirrhosis.

The USPIs for VIEKIRA PAK and TECHNIVIE were updated following post-marketing reports of hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including liver transplantation or fatal outcomes, in patients receiving AbbVie's HCV treatment, with or without RBV. Most patients with these severe outcomes had evidence of advanced cirrhosis prior to initiating therapy.

Horizon takes seriously its responsibility to ensure patients have access to our medicines.

Eliminating the burden of access: A majority of all insurers, large and small, cover Horizon medicines in some form. The healthcare system is highly complex and through its access program, Horizon ensures that physicians can prescribe its medicines with a minimal level of administrative steps so that patients can receive them at the lowest level of out of pocket costs possible. In addition, Horizon commented yesterday on its relationship with specialty pharmacies. All pharmacies that distribute Horizon branded medicines are fully independent, including those that are part of Horizon's Prescriptions Made Easy program. Horizon does not own or have an ownership stake in any pharmacy and does not possess an option to purchase any pharmacy.

Co announces topline results through 90 days of therapy from its Phase 2b clinical trial of OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

In the trial, the duration of effect as measured by the clinically meaningful reduction of intraocular pressure (:IOP) in the 4.5-5.7 mmHg range was observed out to 90 days with the sustained release OTX-TP drug product. The IOP lowering was comparable to levels seen in the treatment group with the same drug release rate in the Phase 2a clinical trial of OTX-TP.

In a 2b trial, the patient group receiving timolol as a comparator drug in the presence of a placebo depot, achieved IOP lowering results that were higher than expected, based on results reported in the peer-reviewed literature. There have been no serious adverse events observed to date in the Phase 2b trial.

Co observed a significant improvement in retention of the depot over prior studies through day 75, achieving 88% retention in the combined arms in the study.

Co also noted that the timolol group within the trial was observed to have intraocular pressure lowering of 6.4-7.6 (with an average of 7.0) mmHg compared with baseline, and as noted, this was higher than expected, possibly due to enhanced residence time of the drug on the ocular surface due to occlusion of the punctum by the placebo vehicle depot.

The Phase 2b interim results are reported on all patients followed through a 90-day duration. Complete results on safety and efficacy through the end of the study are expected to be available in the 1Q16. Co plans to investigate in non-significant risk studies whether the presence of the high-retaining placebo depots can be enhancing the effect of timolol, as this has been reported in the literature.

4:11 pm Closing Market Summary: Stimulus Hopes Send Stocks Higher Despite Mixed Earnings (:WRAPX) :

It was a running of the bulls on Thursday and "re-examine" was the trigger that sparked the charge. The S&P 500 soared 1.7%, overtaking its 100-day moving average (2,038) in the process. The benchmark index settled near its best level of the day, registering its first close above the 100-day average since August 17, as hopes for more stimulus overshadowed mixed corporate earnings.

The stock market was off to the races after equity futures revved higher an hour before the opening bell. The pre-market activity took place in response to comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, who addressed the media following the latest ECB policy meeting. During his press conference, Mr. Draghi said that the central bank will "re-examine" its asset purchases at the December meeting. This was immediately interpreted as a harbinger of more monetary easing in the near future, sending the euro lower while European equities and U.S. futures spiked. Those moves accelerated after Mr. Draghi revealed that the governing council had discussed lowering the deposit facility rate at today's policy meeting. Markets in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy jumped between 2.0% and 2.5% while the euro slid throughout the session to 1.1110 against the dollar after trading just above 1.1300 prior to Mario Draghi's press conference. As a result, the Dollar Index (96.44, +1.37) spiked 1.4%, returning to levels last seen in late September.

Nine sectors ended the day with gains of 1.2% or more, masking the mixed nature of quarterly reports released between yesterday's closing bell and today's open. For instance, Caterpillar (CAT 70.88, +1.98) spiked 2.9% despite missing estimates and lowering its earnings guidance while 3M (MMM 156.00, +6.18) jumped 4.1% after missing revenue estimates, lowering its guidance, and announcing restructuring plans that will involve 1,500 layoffs worldwide. Meanwhile, American Express (AXP 72.50, -4.01) also delivered a disappointing report, but did not get lifted by the tide, falling 5.2%.

To be fair, a few companies delivered better than expected reports with McDonald's (MCD 110.87, +8.33) surging 8.1% to a fresh all-time high and Texas Instruments (TXN 58.09, +6.19) spiking 11.9% after both beat their respective estimates. Texas Instruments contributed to a 3.5% spike in the PHLX Semiconductor Index, which in turn, underpinned the technology sector (+2.3%). That being said, even the two standouts of the day fit an all-too-familiar theme of bottom-line beats combined with sluggish revenue growth.

Elsewhere, PulteGroup (PHM 18.16, -1.29) and Kinder Morgan (KMI 29.75, -1.67) posted respective losses of 6.6% and 5.3% in reaction to disappointing reports; however, their weakness was overshadowed by the broad market strength.

Similarly, Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX 109.87, -8.74) had another woeful showing, tumbling 7.4% to extend its two-day loss to 24.7% after Citron Research voiced concerns of potential accounting fraud at the biotech company. On a related note, the health care sector (-0.6%) spent the day in negative territory.

Treasuries bounced around their flat lines throughout the day with the 10-yr yield respecting a six-basis point range before ending unchanged at 2.03%.

Today's trading volume was well above average with more than a billion shares changing hands at the NYSE floor.

Economic data included Initial Claims, Existing Home Sales, Leading Indicators, and FHFA Housing Price Index:

The weekly initial claims level increased to 259,000 for the week ending October 17 from an upwardly revised 256,000 (from 255,000) while the Briefing.com consensus expected an increase to 265,000 The four-week moving average fell to 263,250 from 265,250, representing the lowest level since December 1973

Existing home sales increased 4.7% in September to 5.55 million from a downwardly revised 5.30 million (from 5.31 mln) while the Briefing.com consensus expected an increase to 5.39 million Unfortunately, the growth in sales may not stable, considering much of the gain resulted from an increase in all-cash and investor demand All-cash sales accounted for 24% of all sales in September, up from 22% in August. Individual investors purchased 13% of existing homes in September, up from 12% in August

The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index declined 0.2% (consensus -0.1%) in September after a downward revision resulted in no change (from 0.1%) in August

The FHFA Housing Price Index for August rose 0.3%, which followed an unrevised increase of 0.6% in July

There is no economic data on tomorrow's schedule.
