As it struggles with a turnaround, BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) sharply missed quarterly earnings estimates Friday and announced plans to make a smartphone based on the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system.

BlackBerry reported revenue of $491 million, well below the consensus of $610.6 million, as polled by Thomson Reuters; it was down 47% from the year-earlier quarter. This was the ninth quarter in a row of double-digit declines. BlackBerry reported a per-share loss minus items of 13 cents, missing the consensus of a 9-cent loss and widening from a 2-cent loss, for its fiscal Q2, which ended Aug. 29.

BlackBerry stock was down 5%, near 6.50, in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near two-year lows. When it was king of the smartphone market in 2008, prior to the ascension of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, BlackBerry stock peaked at 148.13. Apple's first iPhone came out in 2007.

The rise of the iPhone and the phones based on Android quickly swamped BlackBerry. In Q2 BlackBerry said that it had "recognized hardware revenue on over 800,000 BlackBerry smartphones" â€” down from 1.1 million in fiscal Q1.

BlackBerry's turnaround effort focuses on expanding its software base and making more money from its portfolio of patents while it continues to make smartphones mostly targeting business professionals.

Its new Android device, called Priv, is expected to launch later this year. The phone will have a touch screen and slide-out keyboard.

"Priv combines the best of BlackBerry security and productivity with the expansive mobile application ecosystem available on the Android platform," BlackBerry CEO John Chen said in the company's earnings release.

The BlackBerry Android device was widely expected and marks a shift away from the company's BlackBerry 10 platform, which has failed to gain traction against Apple and Google.

BlackBerry is betting on a turnaround on growth in its software business. It expects sales of enterprise mobility management and secure communications software to offset the impact of plummeting service access fee revenue and slow sales of its smartphones.

This month, BlackBerry announced that it would acquire security software maker Good Technology for $425 million in cash, moving further into the mobile device management market.

From these initiatives, Chen said that he anticipated "modest sequential revenue growth in each of the remaining quarters of fiscal 2016."

BlackBerry will continue to develop the BlackBerry 10 operating system and plans to release platform updates focused on security and privacy enhancements, with the next update scheduled to be available in March 2016, the company said.
