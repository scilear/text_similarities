Even as the automaker's board met to approve the 62-year-old Mueller's promotion, authorities said the company had rigged tests on 2.8 million diesel vehicles sold in Germany, roughly six times as many as have been impacted in the U.S.

"He's walking into a firestorm," said analyst Joe Phillippi, of AutoTrends Consulting. But Phillippi stressed that even if Mueller can come up with a "fix-it plan," VW's troubles are far from over, "and are going to take years to resolve."

There's no question that the German automaker—which operates a dozen brands, ranging from entry-level Seat and Skoda to high-line marques Audi, Bentley and Bugatti—has some desperate and immediate challenges.

VW officials this week acknowledged the company used special software code, dubbed a "defeat device," to get its diesel models to recognize when they were undergoing emissions tests. Otherwise, the engine control system would be relaxed, allowing the vehicles to produce up to 40 times the legal limit in the U.S. of noxious emissions.

The carmaker has ordered a stop-sale for those vehicles in the U.S. while it works up a solution. It's unclear if software updates alone can fix things. If not, VW might have to compensate owners for reduced performance and mileage, perhaps even buy back some vehicles.
