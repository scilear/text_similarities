General Electric Co. is exploring acquisitions to expand the newly created digital unit, the business that helps customers use data collected from industrial equipment.

Any such purchases would be part of about $10 billion in dealmaking that GE is targeting for the next two to three years, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said Friday. The company would be willing to go beyond that figure if it finds a “compelling” opportunity, he said.

“Part of that will be focused on everything we’re doing in GE Digital around Predictivity, filling out capabilities in our Industrial Internet offerings,” Bornstein said in a telephone interview after GE’s third-quarter earnings report.

Digital acquisitions would underscore the importance that GE attaches to the “Industrial Internet” -- its name for the effort to marry computer services to the broad lineup of industrial products bought by customers including airlines, hospitals, utilities and railroads. Big data is supposed to help companies find savings by analyzing their operations in real time.

GE formed a new division last month to oversee its software and analytics operations, which include a development center in California. Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt said at the time that the business could grow from $6 billion this year to “a top-10 software company by 2020.”

In addition to digital acquisitions, GE may consider deals in the oil and gas industry, Bornstein said. "We’re in a fortunate position of being financially in a place where we’re certainly capable of taking advantage of opportunities," he said.

Fresh dealmaking would extend a dramatic portfolio reshaping already under way at Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE, including an expansion of the power unit with the 8.5 billion-euro ($9.64 billion) deal for Alstom SA’s energy business. GE has announced $126 billion of divestitures this year in its GE Capital lending unit as it moves away from financial services.
