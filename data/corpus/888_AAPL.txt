September 2015 Updates for Sprint and T-Mobile

(Continued from Prior Part)

First weekend of sales for new iPhones

In the previous part of this series, we learned that John Legere, CEO and chairman of T-Mobile (TMUS), highlighted a greater-than-30% increase in preorders of new iPhone 6s for the telecom company compared to the figures for iPhone 6, which launched last year.

Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) announced its record first weekend of sales of the new iPhone models. According to Apple’s press release on September 28, 2015, “it has sold more than 13 million new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models, a new record, just three days after launch.”

As you can see in the above figure, the first weekend of sales for the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus in September 2014 exceeded 10 million. However, unlike in the figure for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the first weekend of sales for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus includes China, a key, rapidly growing market for Apple.

Apple’s iPhone upgrade program in the US

Starting on September 25, 2015, Apple is offering its annual iPhone upgrade program for the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models at Apple’s retail stores in the US. The plan gives customers the benefit of choosing wireless services among AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), T-Mobile, and Sprint (S) during each upgrade. This is a 24-month device financing option, and customers must choose a provider among the top four US wireless carriers.

You can consider taking a diversified exposure to Apple by investing in the PowerShares QQQ ETF (QQQ), which held ~13.2% in the company at the end of August 2015.
