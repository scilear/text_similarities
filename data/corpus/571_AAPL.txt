NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) shares are retreating 0.52% to $109.82 on Monday after Citigroup reduced its iPhone sales forecast for the fiscal fourth quarter, MarketWatch reports.

IPhone unit sales estimate was lowered to 47 million from 48 million, analysts noted.

Specifically, the reduction was because only Friday and Saturday sales from its opening weekend would be counted in the tech giant's fourth quarter results, and not Sunday, which is counted in its first quarter fiscal 2016 sales, analysts said.

However, the firm is still keeping its "buy" rating on the Cupertino, CA-based company and its price target of $145.

Additionally, Apple's mobile-payments system, Apple Pay, has not gained much traction with consumers in the U.S., Bloomberg said.

According to researcher Aite Group, the payment system that allows users to pay for products by tapping their iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch on cash registers, accounts for about 1% of total retail transactions in the U.S.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results.
