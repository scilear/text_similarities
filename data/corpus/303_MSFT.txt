Microsoft has struck a partnership with Chinese internet giant Baidu, as it continues to focus on getting people on Windows 10. Via blog post, the Redmond-based firm said the idea behind this business alliance is to make it easy for Baidu customers to upgrade to its new OS, as well as offer personalized browsing and searching experiences for users in China. For example, Baidu.com -- which has more than 600 million active users -- will become the default homepage and search engine for Microsoft's Edge browser. In return, Baidu is expected to bring standalone, universal apps for cloud, search, maps and video over to Windows 10. Microsoft adds there are currently 10 million devices running the fresh operating system in that country, a huge chunk of the reported 45 million-plus total number.
