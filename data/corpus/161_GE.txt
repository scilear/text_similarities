Trian Fund Management's 1% stake in General Electric (NYSE:GE) may have repercussions on a possible deal between GE and energy giant Halliburton (NYSE:HAL).

GE reportedly has been bidding for parts of Halliburton's drilling services and drilling bits units. The Houston-based energy services company is under pressure from the Justice Department to sell off some of its businesses to alleviate antitrust concerns related to its $35 billion deal to buy rival Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).

The DOJ also reportedly wants Halliburton to offload $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer vs. several in order to pass antitrust hurdles, leaving only global giants like GE and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) as potential buyers.

But Trian, which has acquired 98.5 million shares of GE stock for $2.5 billion, said it wants GE to be disciplined in its acquisitions. Whether a Halliburton deal fits into that picture remains to be seen.

The activist fund also wants GE to expand its margins, explore more share buybacks, and mull additional ways to consider scaling back GE Capital.

For now, Trian appears to be on board with GE CEO Jeff Immelt's overall industrial-focused strategy. In a statement, the fund said it "believes GE is executing a bold transformation that will generate attractive stockholder returns in the years ahead."

Nelson Peltz, Trian's founder and CEO, called General Electric "undervalued and underappreciated by the market." Trian is not asking for representation on GE's board.

The Fairfield, Conn.-based GE has been on a selling spree of its own, selling off units as it focuses on industrial products.

GE shares closed up 5.3% to 26.82 in the stock market today, pushing above its 200-day moving average. Halliburton shares climbed 2.5%, finishing at 37.71. Baker Hughes rose 2.4%, and rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) also rallied 2.5%.
