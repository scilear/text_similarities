BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's motor transport agency is ordering a mandatory recall of Volkswagen cars sold with software that enabled them to evade diesel emissions testing.

The dpa news agency reported that the Federal Motor Transport Authority rejected a Volkswagen proposal for a voluntary recall.

Germany's Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt is set to announce details of the recall later Thursday.

Volkswagen CEO Matthias Mueller has said a recall could start in January and be completed by the end of next year in Germany. The company has said around 11 million cars worldwide, 2.8 million of them in Germany, have the software that duped U.S. inspectors.

Volkswagen faces possible fines after U.S. authorities discovered it had equipped 482,000 cars with software that disabled emissions controls except when the cars were being tested.
