NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of AutoZone (AZO - Get Report) are up slightly Monday despite being upgraded to outperform from perform by analysts at Oppenheimer & Company.



It's surprising a company like AutoZone was ever rated as just perform, TheStreet's Jim Cramer, co-manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio, said on CNBC's "Stop Trading" segment.

AutoZone is the premier company in the auto parts space, Cramer said, adding that it has one of the most impressive stock buyback programs on the New York Stock Exchange.

Shares of Advanced Auto Parts (AAP - Get Report) are more interesting too because it now has Starboard Value as an activist investor.



Cramer said those at Starboard will be "constructive" activists, not the bully type of activists seen more frequently over the past few years. AutoZone is the model to what Advanced Auto Parts should try to become, he added.

Turning to General Electric (GE - Get Report) , shares are up 4% on news the company is selling its corporate aircraft financing portfolio and has activist investor Nelson Peltz' Trian Fund Management on board. General Electric is a buy, not a sell, Cramer said.
