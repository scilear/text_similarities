September 2015 Updates for Sprint and T-Mobile

(Continued from Prior Part)

T-Mobile’s $5 monthly option for iPhone 6s

In the previous part of this series, we learned about the expectations for T-Mobile’s (TMUS) postpaid phone net additions in 3Q15. Apple (AAPL) announced its new iPhone models, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, in the September 9 event.

The top four US wireless carriers—Verizon (VZ), AT&T (T), T-Mobile, and Sprint (S)—have plans to tap into the demand for these new iPhones in the US. T-Mobile is offering a $5 per month option with a trade-in with its Jump! On Demand plan for the entry-level iPhone 6s model.

iPhone 6s service pricing options

Discussing the pricing of these options for new iPhones, T-Mobile’s press release stated, “$5 a month for iPhone 6s 16GB and $9 a month for iPhone 6s Plus 16GB with JUMP! On Demand and trade-in of an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus.” According to the company, the lease duration is 18 months.

The company’s press release added, “T-Mobile’s new pricing builds on the Un-carrier’s straightforward $20 a month for a new iPhone 6s 16GB with JUMP! On Demand without a trade-in.”

iPhone 6s preorders

A September 23 report by Fortune cited a tweet by John Legere, T-Mobile CEO and president, on the iPhone 6s preorders for T-Mobile. According to Legere’s tweet on September 22, the carrier had a growth of greater than 30% for iPhone 6s preorders compared to iPhone 6 previous that it had the previous year.

Instead of taking a direct exposure to T-Mobile’s stock, you may consider taking a diversified exposure to the company by investing in the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD). This ETF had ~0.1% of its holdings in T-Mobile at the end of August 2015.
