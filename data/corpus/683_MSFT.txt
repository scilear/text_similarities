Bilton points to the skyscraper index as further evidence of a new tech bubble.



"At the beginning of every bubble burst or every recession, there's always been a race to build the biggest skyscrapers in the world. And it's usually from money that has come in from bubble-gotten gains," he said. "Often when you have these buildings built, there isn't anyone to fill them and it starts to be one of the things that causes the bubble to burst," Bilton posited.

The skyscraper indicating a bubble this time around, according to Bilton, is the Salesforce Tower, which is currently under construction. That skyscraper is expected to stand 200 feet higher than the Transamerica Pyramid, which is currently the tallest building on the San Francisco skyline.

But whether there's a bubble at risk of bursting or just some high-flying start-ups that need to gear up for a descent, Bilton seems conservative.

"My best advice to protect yourself is put your money in your mattress," Bilton said.
