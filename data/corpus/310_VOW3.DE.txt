The software emissions scandal that has swept up 11 million Volkswagen cars and possibly put the entire company at risk has also left owners looking to sell their cars in a holding pattern.

James McComb, a student from Long Island, New York, who is trying to sell a 2002 Volkswagen Jetta 1.8T for $4,500 on Craigslist, said he hasn’t received a single response. The car has 91,000 miles on it and just passed inspection, has fresh tires and new brakes, and a transmission that “shifts as it should.”

“Good on gas in both city and especially on the highway,” says McComb’s listing.

It includes an exhaustive list of expenses and repairs he’s paid over the years totaling $5,645, not including what he paid for the car. Still, no takers.

“Maybe there really is a smear on the brand,” he said in an email.

Since the news broke on Friday, Volkswagen AG VOW, +3.29% has set aside $7.3 billion to cover legal costs. What exactly those costs will entail and how the business will be impacted are still up in the air. Meanwhile, discussion boards are lighting up with questions and possible solutions.

On VW Vortex, a Volkswagen enthusiast site, a prospective buyer who says they’re having “second thoughts” about buying a 1.8T Golf SEL asks whether anyone else feels the same way.

“VW knowingly lied about ‘clean’ diesel while making ‘clean’ diesel their main selling point in the U.S.A. It’s a question of trust,” wrote Dezlboy, who owns a 2000 Golf TDI GLS, in response.

Others are happy with their purchase and won’t be swayed by scandal.

“Well, probably solidified my decision to buy an e-Golf vs TDI but that’s about it,” wrote DasCC. “To me this is nowhere near the moral issue such as GM GM, +0.00% faulty ignitions etc.”
