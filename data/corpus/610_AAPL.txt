SAN FRANCISCO (TheStreet) -- Though there weren't many physical changes to the iPhone, Apple (AAPL - Get Report) did more than enough to keep the economic engine running on full throttle, analysts say,

"The new iPhones have enough new features to make them an interesting upgrade for those who always have to have the latest device from Apple, with 3D Touch the biggest new feature," Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said via email.

With 3D Touch, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have the capability to sense pressure on the screen, allowing users to perform different tasks based upon how hard they press. If a user presses lightly on the screen, they can look or "peek" into a photo, email or web page. If a user presses harder, they can go into the content itself.

3D Touch, which was known as Force Touch on the Apple Watch and MacBook, also provide shortcuts for actions users take most often.

The iPhone is the primary revenue driver for Apple, as it accounted for $31.3 billion out of a total $49.6 billion worth of revenue in the company's most recent quarter. Apple sold 47.5 million iPhones during the quarter, up 35% year-over-year, but down 22% sequentially.

Research firm IHS forecasts Apple will ship 236 million iPhones in 2015, up 23% year on year.

Pre-orders for both models start Sept. 12 and the phones will be available in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, the UK and the U.S. beginning Sept. 25.

Aside from 3D Touch, which IHS analysts Ian Fogg, Wayne Lam, Daniel Gleeson and Francis Sideco say will help revolutionize games and apps, and force existing iPhone owners to upgrade, the biggest improvements appear to be camera and photo related.
