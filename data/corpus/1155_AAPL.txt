One user called Antricksh Saxena wrote: "Why is there not an option to give negative stars? I hope this app gets kicked out of the Play Store soon."

Josh Holmes gave it one-star, writing: "Apple's first contribution to Android and this is what they offer? Ridiculous.

"Google has dozens of apps in the Apple App Store, none of which attempt to move users away from Apple and into Android.

"This is like Walmart installing a kiosk inside Target (NYSE: TGT - news) that would replace a Target gift card with a Walmart gift card. Such practice is not acceptable. Apple has hit a new low."

Another complaint said: "Dear Apple just why did you make this app?

"You refuse to release your apps onto Android because Apple is 'superior' in your minds but that just turns most users away from Apple because they think they are the best and never change.

"But Google has their apps on your app store and many people switch from Apple because they want freedom."
