In case you haven’t heard, Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) has been cheating on its U.S. emissions testing in diesel cars. This won’t just impact sales in the United States, but globally since the cheating has occurred in 11 million vehicles across different markets. Investors are asking if the precipitous drop of nearly 20% in VLKAY seen on Monday is a buying opportunity. The answer is simple.

Teachable Moment

What many investors fail to understand is that the stock market can be beaten with an active management strategy if you apply logic. In addition to industry strength and weakness, which are tremendous factors, compounding plays a huge role. This pertains to the up side as well as the down side. To find the best long and short positions throughout the broader market, you need to eliminate 90%-95% of stocks based on key metrics. With the remaining 5%-10% where those key metrics are either very impressive or extremely poor, look at industry strength or weakness. If a company possesses very impressive key metrics across the board and it’s in a strong industry while also not being burdened by debt, then you have likely just found a winner. If a company possesses extremely poor key metrics, is in a weak or weakening industry and the company is overleveraged, then you have likely just found a good short opportunity.

Don’t fall into the trap of trying to pick a bottom. In most cases, downward pressure will continue because it will compound on itself. And whether you’re going long or short, don’t fear v-shaped recoveries in individual stocks because they rarely take place. If you’re long on a stock and the trend changes, you should have time to see it because buying will become exhausted and the stock will flat line for weeks, if not months. The same rule applies to the down side. If a company is pulling off an effective turnaround, or its industry is strengthening, then you should first see exhausted selling, not an immediate rebound. The two big risks on the short side are a short squeeze or a company being acquired. You can sometimes ride out the former, but not the latter. That’s why diversification is key, even on the short side.

To find the best opportunities on the long and short side, it all comes down to finding companies/stocks that are currently experiencing the virtuous cycle or the vicious cycle. (For more, see: Diversification: Protecting Portfolios from Mass Destruction.)

All numbers below as of Sept. 22, 2015.

Applying the Above to Volkswagen

First take a look at the company’s top and bottom-line performance over three past three fiscal years:

VLKAY FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 Revenue $254,026,000 $271,468,000 $244,985,000 Net Income $28,848,000 $12,601,000 $13,393,000

Based on the chart above, the top line took a hit in FY2014. The bottom line improved, but it didn’t reach the FY2012 level. For a better understanding at what has taken place recently, let’s take a look at quarterly results. (For more, see: Key Financial Ratios to Analyze the Automotive Industry.)

VLKAY Sep 30, 2014 Dec 31, 2014 Mar 31, 2015 Jun 30, 2015 Revenue $51,324,000 $58,378,000 $56,638,000 $64,561,000 Net Income $3,148,000 $2,419,000 $3,149,000 $3,161,000

There was a spike on the top line last quarter, but if you add the previous four quarters, the revenue total is $230 billion, which is well short of FY2014.

Volkswagen has a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.19. This isn’t overly impressive, but it’s not elevated, either. The problem is that Volkswagen has set aside $7.3 billion to cover the costs of its recent scandal, which could involve some 11 million cars. This in itself will negatively impact the bottom line, but this is before we get to lawsuits and a decline in consumer and investor trust. The stock has depreciated 30.57% over the past 12 months; it was as high as $52.50 as recently as the end of April. As of mid-day on Sept. 22, VLKAY was trading in the $25 range. Any negative news is going to add to that pressure.

Volkswagen is currently in danger of becoming trapped in the vicious cycle. It might not be the best short opportunity on the board, but it’s light years from the best long opportunity available. (For more, see: A Quick Explanation of How Short Selling Works.)

The Bottom Line

Due to recent events, Volkswagen is going to see extra costs, slower sales, the likelihood of smaller profits and a decline in consumer and investor trust on a global level. This will lead to reduced capital, which will then lead to fewer innovative and marketing opportunities. Investors might want to think twice before looking at VLKAY as a bargain opportunity for now.
