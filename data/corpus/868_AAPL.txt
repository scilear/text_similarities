On September 29, Google launched two new Nexus phones manufactured by Huawei of China and LG of South Korea (EWY), named Huawei Nexus 6P and LG Nexus 5X respectively. Nexus 6P boasts a 5.7-inch screen and a 12.3-megapixel camera. The LG Nexus 5X comes with a 64-bit Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon processor and a 2,700 mAh battery.

Google’s motive behind launching these smartphones is not necessarily to gain share in the smartphone market but to grow its Android ecosystem. Google wants to resolve any issues that crop up when different smartphone manufacturers adopt the Android operating system without seamlessly integrating hardware features with the software. This is where Apple has the advantage, as it designs its own hardware and develops its own operating system.

Although Android dominates the smartphone operating system market with more than 80% share, it gave up a small percentage to Apple in the last year. The success of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus clearly played a role in this gain for Apple, as the chart above shows.
