LAS VEGAS (AP) -- An official says a damaged engine will be removed from a British Airways aircraft that aborted takeoff and caught fire on a Las Vegas airport runway, forcing 170 people to evacuate.

National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Eric Weiss said Monday the engine will be taken to a General Electric facility for more tests by NTSB, Boeing and GE investigators.

Weiss says no immediate updates are planned.

Firefighters quickly doused flames Sept. 8 while the Boeing 777 was evacuated at McCarran International Airport. It was flight 2276 bound for London.

The NTSB says fragments of high-pressure engine compressor were found on the runway, and the engine casing was perforated.

British Airways and the British Civil Aviation Authority are assisting the probe of the cause of engine failure and fire.
