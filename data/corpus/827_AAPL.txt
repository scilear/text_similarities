Biting into Apple: The New Apple TV

(Continued from Prior Part)

Apple revamps its new Apple TV remote

Apple (AAPL) gave a preview of its new Apple TV at an Apple media event in San Francisco on September 9. Apple has done away with the traditional TV channels and has replaced them with apps like Netflix (NFLX). This is similar to another connected TV device, Google’s (GOOG) Chromecast. Apple has also revamped its remote for the new Apple TV.

The new remote is far sleeker as compared to its predecessors. Apple has done away with a host of buttons in a traditional remote control, revamping it with fewer buttons and a touchpad that lets the user swipe through apps and click on menus. The new remote is also equipped with a microphone button to activate Apple’s voice-based assistant, Siri. For example, if a user voices the desire to watch drama to Siri using the microphone button on the remote, Apple TV will show the user a list of drama programs on the screen.

The remote uses a Bluetooth technology to connect with the Apple TV instead of the traditional infrared one. This means that there is no need for a user to point the remote at the Apple TV for the TV to respond to user commands. The new remote can also be used for playing games by tilting it sideways or holding it horizontally.

Flip side of the Apple TV remote

The flip side of the Apple TV remote is that it is not like a full-fledged game controller for playing games. The remote comes equipped with an accelerometer for playing games, but it is not the same as a pure game controller for a gaming console like Sony’s (SNE) Playstation 4. It means that a user can play casual games on the new Apple TV, but not motion-controlled games.

You can get a diversified exposure to Apple by investing in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which holds 3.84% of the stock.
