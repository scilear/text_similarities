NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs would have been 60 earlier this year, had it not been for his untimely death four years ago Monday.

Jobs, who had a way with words, had opinions on nearly every topic, including life, love, succeeding in business, and a whole lot more.

Inspired by this tweet from current Apple CEO Timothy D. Cook, here are 10 more quotes from Jobs, compiled from Brainyquote.com, on how to do just about anything you can set your mind to.

"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma -- which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition."
