Communications app Skype has been down for several hours across the world, with Microsoft promising an urgent "quick fix".

Thousands of people used social media on Monday to complain that they could not make calls using the popular app.

Affected users are unable to change their status, start Skype calls, or see their contacts.

The web version of Skype still appears to work.

A message on Skype's website said: "Some of you may experience problems with Skype presence and may not see online. We have detected an issue with the status settings of Skype.

"Affected users will not be able to change their status, their contacts will all show as offline and they will be unable to start Skype calls to them.

"We're working on a fix for this issue and hope to have an update for you soon. Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused while we get this resolved."

Skype was launched in 2003, and has more than 600 million worldwide users.

Microsoft bought it in 2011 for $8bn (Â£5.1bn).
