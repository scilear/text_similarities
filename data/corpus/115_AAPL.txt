Are the wheels starting to come off for Tesla Motors' stock? A little more air was let out of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock Friday after Barclays analyst Brian Johnson downgraded the high-profile electric-car maker and cut his price target.

Tesla stock was down 2% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 222, setting the stock up for a fifth straight down day. Tesla stock is down 10% from its Oct. 2 close and is nearly 24% off its all-time intraday high above 286, reached 13 months ago.

Johnson downgraded Tesla to underweight from equal weight and cut his price target on Tesla stock to 180 from 190.

"Our fundamental difference with the Tesla bulls lies around the company's ability to become a successful mass-market (original equipment manufacturer)," Johnson said in a research note. "While the bulls believe Tesla will be the next Ford (NYSE:F), we see many challenges ahead for Tesla and argue that 'crossing the chasm' is harder than it looks."

Johnson said recent developments regarding the company's new Model X car prompted him to lower his rating. The company started delivering its crossover SUV Model X late last week.

"Launch events typically generate a run-up into the event, with some payback after," Johnson wrote. "Yet last week's X launch failed to boost the shares â€” indicating a lack of 'story'-driven buying support."

Tesla CEO Elon Musk was quoted this week as saying that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn't pose a serious threat to Tesla's business. Talk of Apple fulfilling the late Steve Jobs' dream of entering the car business has prompted some analysts to suggest that Apple could pose a challenge to Tesla, known for its innovative electric vehicles with long-lasting batteries.

Musk was quoted in the German newspaper Handelsblatt as saying that Apple has become "Tesla's graveyard." He said workers who don't make it at Tesla end up working for Apple.
