When Microsoft released Windows 10 Mobile build 10536 to Insider users earlier this week, it probably didn't expect it to break user's phones. It did. Turns out,the update was only meant for certain devices, but a device check glitch allowed non-support devices to see, download and apply the new build. That's bad -- but Microsoft is trying to fix it.

@iamcadz @cherrymobilePH DO NOT INSTALL unless your phone is on the list of supported devices. Won't work and you'll need to reflash. — Gabriel Aul (@GabeAul) September 15, 2015 This is a high priority for us to solve and have a team dedicated to it. We will let you know as soon as we have info on recovery. — Gabriel Aul (@GabeAul) September 17, 2015

According to Microsoft's Gabriel Aul, installing the update on non-supported devices will essentially break the phone -- and the only way to fix it is to reflash back to the factory image, which most users probably don't have. There's no fix available for users who have already installed the mislabeled build, but Microsoft says it's on the case. ""We're working on repair options for the devices that were not supported but got the latest build," Aul said on Twitter. "This is a high priority for us to solve and have a team dedicated to it. We will let you know as soon as we have info on recovery." Best course of action right now? Turn off Windows Insider updates, follow @GabeAul on Twitter, and wait.
