General Electric is rallying after earnings report this morning, and traders are looking for gains to continue through early next year.



optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker system detected an early purchase of 5,000 January 31 calls for $0.19 in one print this morning. This is clearly a new position, as volume was nearly double the strike's previous open interest of 2,640 contracts.



These long calls lock in the price where the stock can be purchased through mid-January no matter how far it might climb. They could be sold earlier at a profit if premiums rise with a rally before then, providing potentially significant leverage, but the contracts will expire worthless if shares remain below $31.

GE is up 1.39 percent to $28.42 this morning after reporting mixed quarterly results in the pre-market. The industrial conglomerate gapped up from the $25 level on Oct. 2 as it continued to divest financial holdings and is up 8 percent in the last month.



Calls make up more than 62 percent of the total option volume in GE so far today.
