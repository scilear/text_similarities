General Electric Co. on Friday reported better-than-expected adjusted profit in its third quarter, as higher aviation and transportation earnings helped boost its core industrials business.

GE GE, +2.53% said it would begin a share exchange to spin off Synchrony Financial, its consumer finance business, next week, after receiving clearance from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The share swap will help GE exit another major piece of its lending business while retiring 6% to 7% of GE’s roughly 10 billion shares.

Overall for the period ended Sept. 30, GE reported a profit of $2.51 billion, or 25 cents a share, compared with a profit of $3.54 billion, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Overall revenue ticked down 1.3% to $31.68 billion.

Excluding the finance businesses being wound down, GE reported a profit of 29 cents a share, while revenue came in its $27.9 billion.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast earnings of 26 cents and revenue of $28.57 billion excluding those businesses.

Corrections & Amplifications:

GE’s revenue, excluding finance businesses it is winding down, fell short of analysts’ expectations. An earlier version of this article and its headline incorrectly said the company’s revenue beat analysts’ views.
