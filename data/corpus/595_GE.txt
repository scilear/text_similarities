NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Bill Ackman won't be following fellow billionaire Nelson Peltz into General Electric (GE - Get Report) , but there are some other investments in the Trian Fund Management portfolio he might like.

In early October, activist investor Peltz disclosed that his Trian Fund Management had accumulated a $2.5 billion stake in GE, calling the company "undervalued and underappreciated by the market" in a statement. Trian also made a push for an increase in share repurchases, citing what it perceives as an opportunity for GE to return more than 40% of its market cap to stockholders by 2018 (a move that could impact its credit rating).

Ackman expressed his support of Peltz's GE thesis in an interview with Bloomberg, but he made it clear his Pershing Square Capital Management wouldn't be following Trian's path. "It's a company that's been an absolute failure in terms of how they've allocated capital," he said. "It's really the deal-making part of GE that's been the problem, not the way the businesses are run."

He also revealed he had examined a potential investment in the company but decided it "wasn't cheap enough."

Though Peltz and Ackman have different takes on General Electric, there is one investment they coincide on: Mondelez (MDLZ - Get Report) . Peltz is a long-time shareholder of the food and beverage company, and Ackman picked up a multi-billion-dollar activist stake in the company in August.

Ackman hasn't shown signals of joining Peltz in any other of his holdings, but that could always change. Here are three other Trian stocks he may look into.
