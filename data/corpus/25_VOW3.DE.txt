BERLIN (AP) -- Prosecutors investigating Volkswagen's use of emissions test-cheating software in some of its diesel engines say they're putting together a special team of detectives to evaluate the massive amount of data seized from the car manufacturer.

Braunschweig prosecutors' spokesman Klaus Ziehe said Friday that state police are putting together a group of about 20 investigators to work with his office on the case.

Ziehe's office last week raided VW headquarters as part of its investigation to determine who was responsible for suspected fraud committed through the sale of vehicles that are able to cheat on emissions tests.

The hope is to get the investigation team together within a few days to help go through the material seized.

Ziehe says "we're talking terabytes, not gigabytes, and certainly many cartons of paper."
