NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- General Electric (GE - Get Report) announced its subsidiary GE Aviation will invest more than $400 million to create a turboprop engine development, test and production operation in Europe.

The company said it will build abroad for its customers to be able to access government-sponsored export credit agencies, since the U.S. Export Import Bank authorization expired on July 1.

"Right now, across the entire company, GE has $11 billion in sales opportunities in the pipeline requiring ECA financing," GE Aviation CEO David Joyce said. "The uncertainty around the Ex-Im Bank in the U.S. requires that companies like GE create alternatives in order to compete internationally."

GE will also invest $23 million to expand its engine testing unit the Winnipeg facility in Canada and $55 million to expand the new engine testing facility in the Celma plant in Brazil.

GE stock is down 0.27% to $25.63 in afternoon trading on Thursday.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates GENERAL ELECTRIC CO as a Hold with a ratings score of C+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (GE) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed â€” some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, good cash flow from operations and expanding profit margins. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including feeble growth in the company's earnings per share, deteriorating net income and generally higher debt management risk."
