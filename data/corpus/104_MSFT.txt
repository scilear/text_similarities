A reality of today's digital world also means that domain availability can be a crucial deciding factor. Many companies can build a strong digital presence with a modified URL, but it's important to determine if having an unmodified .com address is a mandatory at the outset of the naming process.

These criteria help us to narrow down with confidence but ultimately, selecting the final name comes down to preference. And the best name isn't always obvious. Below, our sagest advice for those embarking on the naming process. Good luck, name-seekers!

1. Sleep on it.

It's amazing what time can do to shift your opinion about a name (for better and for worse). Take at least a day before making a final decision.

2. Don't worry about the rationale being obvious.

Most big brand names have a deeper meaning or story behind them that the larger population doesn't know. That doesn't diminish the impact of the name; it merely adds another layer of meaning for those in the know. Take Venmo (vendere means "to sell" in Latin), Google (an accidental misspelling of googol, or 1.0 Ã— 10100), or Nike (the Greek goddess of victory).
