Most of the major indexes picked up steam in the last hour of trading to close with decent gains Monday, though well off their intraday highs. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 rose 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. The Nasdaq managed to eke out a fractional gain after spending some time in the red, as biotechs got hammered.

Volume was lower across the board, as expected, after Friday's quadruple witching. Winners topped losers by a 3-2 ratio on the NYSE, but decliners outpaced advancers on the Nasdaq by a slight margin.

Software, food and financial stocks outperformed in the stock market today. Biotechs and other drugmakers were among the biggest losers, as presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's tweet about the high cost of specialty drugs sent the stocks down hard.

CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) gapped up and rose 4% in fast trade. The stock has found support around the 46 level but is still below its sliding 50-day moving average. Deutsche Bank upgraded the network security software maker to buy from hold, saying the recent sell-off is overdone.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) climbed 2% amid a flurry of news. The iPhone maker has set a 2019 ship date for an electric vehicle, according to the Wall Street Journal. Sprint (NYSE:S) said it will sell the Apple Watch Friday, the same day as the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. And Canaccord Genuity raised its price target on Apple to 160 from 155.

Among IBD 50 biotechs down in volume, Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX) fell 5% on a downward reversal. It gave up the 50-day line, which it had regained earlier in the session. The stock is working on a new consolidation. Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) gave up 3% and sliced its 200-day line intraday. It, too, may be shaping a new base.

The IBD 50 ended with 30 advancers and 19 decliners, with one unchanged.
