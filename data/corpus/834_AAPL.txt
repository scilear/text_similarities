Apple's large-sized iPad is likely to go on sale in the first week of November, according to Japanese Apple news site Macotakara.

The company said in early September that its new larger iPad and Apple Pencil stylus would be released in November, but haven't specified an exact date or time frame.

Macotakara, however, is citing "reliable" sources from China in saying that the iPad Pro will launch in the first week of that month.

Macotakara has a mixed track record when it comes to reporting on upcoming Apple products. It did, however, correctly report in 2013 that the iPhone 5S would come with a new home button without the rectangle Apple has placed in the home buttons of previous iPhones.

The iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen, making it noticeably larger than Apple's 9.7-inch iPad Air. It'll start at $799 for the 32 GB Wi-Fi only configuration.
