If you live in New York or Philadelphia, you may not be getting your pre-ordered iPhone 6s or 6s Plus on time this weekend. That's because Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.53% carrier UPS UPS, +1.11% is temporarily cancelling all pickups and deliveries in certain zip codes where Pope Francis passes through during his week-long visit to the U.S. for security reasons, and FedEx FDX, +2.40% has warned that while it will continue to operate, customers may experience service delays and disruptions because of local restrictions. While the papal visit will impact all sorts of product deliveries, Apple users who preordered the new iPhone have been anticipating its arrival this weekend, with Apple scheduling deliveries starting this Friday. UPS will not offer service at all in certain New York zip codes on Thursday and Friday and in certain zip codes in Philadelphia on Friday and Saturday -- check here for impacted zip codes. Both delivery services said they are implementing contingency plans to minimize delays. (Clarification: an earlier version of this did not clarify in the fourth sentence that UPS's cancellation plans will impact certain zip codes and not the cities in their entirety).
