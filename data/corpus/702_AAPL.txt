Apps are continuing to trickle into Apple's wearable, with recent standouts including Airbnb, Google and...BlackBerry? The company once called RIM has announced Apple Watch support for its messaging service, BBM. When reading the product description on the iTunes store, you find that the companion app will allow you to share photos and voice notes, see when people are responding to your messages, and even offer groundbreaking features like delivered and read receipts. There isn't a wide variety of alternatives available on the Apple Watch at the moment -- with WhatsApp and Facebook messanger still missing from the app store -- but maybe there's a reason for that. What's your PIN? Let's discuss this some more through our wearables.
