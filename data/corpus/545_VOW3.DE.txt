The Environmental Protection Agency's allegation that Volkswagen deliberately evaded the Clean Air Law by defeating emissions testing on 482,000 diesel cars is costing it a coveted endorsement that could hurt sales even further.

Consumer Reports, the magazine that has become the buying bible for many car purchasers, is suspending its "recommended" rating of two VW models: the diesel versions of both the Jetta and larger Passat sedans.

The magazine says the recommendations will remain suspended until it can perform tests on the cars after recall repairs.

"Once the emissions systems are functioning properly, we will assess whether the repair has adversely affected performance or fuel economy," it wrote in a statement.

The EPA accused Volkswagen on Friday of installing software on VW and Audi smaller cars that amounts to a "defeat device," meant to evade federal emissions laws.

The software code allows all of the car's emissions systems to work when the cars are taken in for clean-air testing. But as soon as the emissions tests are complete, the system reverts to spewing pollutants. The cars emitted nitrogen oxide at a level of up to 40 times the standard level, the EPA alleges.

So-called "clean diesels" have been a big part of Volkswagen's and Audi's portfolio. The two brands together account for 17 of the 44 models that offer diesel-powered engines for the 2015 model year, Edmunds.com says.

Volkswagen will be required to recall the vehicles to make sure they meet the emissions thresholds.

The diesel cars under scrutiny in the Volkswagen case are the 2009 to 2014 Volkswagen Jetta, Beetle and Golf; the 2014 and 2015 Volkswagen Passat, and the 2009 to 2015 Audi A3.
