General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is winning the wind turbine war. Its latest innovation is bigger and better than ever before. Worldwide, General Electric Company lays claim to more than 26,000 wind turbines, tallying more than 43,000 MW in capacity. That's enough energy to power around 30 million European homes, and calls into serious question those who call wind energy's long-term viability a fantasy..

In fiscal 2014, GE's renewable energy business (which is primarily wind) was responsible for 23% of General Electric Company's total revenues. The company also noted in its latest annual report that "[we] are seeing growth in...wind...industries." The company's established international presence has also allowed it to move into remote countries like Kenya and Pakistan, while continuing to capitalize on new emission reduction goals in the U.S. and other developed countries.

This turbine is the latest in a lineup that continues to expand and improve, and its unique characteristics continue to push the envelope on how far and fast wind energy can go. Here's what you need to know.
