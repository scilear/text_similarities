Volkswagen, desperate to gain sales in the United States, moved backward in August. The world’s largest car manufacturer sold 32,332 cars, down 8.1% from the same month in 2014.

If it were not for sales of 2,478 Golf SportWagens, the numbers would have been much worse. It is a new model, so 100% of its sales are a lift to the Volkswagen of America monthly total. Sales of the base Golf flattened after being critical to numbers earlier in the year. Base Golf sales were up only 5.6% to 1,873. For the first eight months, sales of the model were up 109% to 15,000. Sales of the Golf R fell in August by 5.9% to 1,709

Sales of the iconic Beetle continued to falter, down 26.8% to 2,127. Sales of the Jetta Sedan, VW’s best-selling model, fell 17.9% to 11,002. VW’s second best-selling model, the Passat, fell 19.4% to 7,409.

Management said that VW would do better next year, but did not say why:

“We are encouraged by the continued strength of the Golf family and confident that success will continue with the model year 2016 vehicles that are equipped with the MIB II infotainment systems and available class leading connectivity features,” said Mark McNabb, chief operating officer, Volkswagen of America.

VW only has five models that have any meaningful sales, which puts it up against U.S. and Japanese companies, some of which have much, much larger fleets.

VW does have a Model Year End Sales Event and is offering a $1,000 Volkswagen Rewards Card. The deal does come with more than one caveat:

Requires purchase of select 2015 Jetta, Passat, or Tiguan models. Allow 8-10 weeks for card delivery. Expires two years from date of issue, except where prohibited. Offer ends September 7, 2015.

The marketing plan may not be enough to improve sales in the final four months of the year.
