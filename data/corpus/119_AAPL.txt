Ford Motor (NYSE:F) plans to invest $1.8 billion over the next five years to research autonomous driving and other smart-car features for the China market, as the tech sector looks to shake up the global auto industry.

Earlier this month, rival General Motors (NYSE:GM) said it's working on a "heightened partnership" with Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) to begin testing self-driving Volts late next year on its Warren Technical Center campus outside Detroit.

The moves come as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly developing an electric car with a target date of 2019 and autonomous capabilities introduced later. Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is developing autonomous features, also with Mobileye technology. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) expects to have self-driving vehicles ready in 2020.

In China, search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is working on its own autonomous technology and has partnered with ride-hailing service Uber.

Ford shares closed up less than 0.1% in the stock market today, and GM finished 0.2% higher. Apple dipped 0.5%, Mobileye slumped 2%, and Tesla ended down 2.3%. Baidu slipped 0.1%.

Ford will also research new smartphone connectivity features for its cars in China, which passed the U.S. to become the world's largest car market a couple of years ago.

The moves are seen as a way for Ford to boost flagging sales in China, where car sales have fallen amid a slowdown in its economic growth rate.

Total sales of passenger cars in China fell to 1.34 million in August, down 9.4% from the same month a year ago amid the cooling economy and new local restrictions meant to reduce air pollution, according to China Passenger Car Association figures.

Ford recently said that it sold 531,702 passenger cars in China through the first eight months of this year, down 1.2% from the same period last year.
