Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced Monday morning that the company sold more than 13 million of its new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models in the first three days after the product launch. At last year’s launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the company reported sales of more than 10 million units on the first weekend.

The big difference in sales between this year and last is likely because the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were not available in China until October 17. This year Chinese customers could buy the 6s and the 6s Plus on the same day as buyers in the United States, Canada and nine other countries around the world.

In its press release Apple did not break down sales by country. The company did note that sales made on Saturday, September 26, will be counted in Apple’s fourth fiscal quarter of 2015. Sunday sales will be counted in the first quarter of the 2016 fiscal year.

While the sales total was no major surprise, Apple CEO Tim Cook had the adjectives ready:

Sales for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any previous first weekend sales results in Apple’s history. Customers’ feedback is incredible and they are loving 3D Touch and Live Photos, and we can’t wait to bring iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to customers in even more countries on October 9.

The new iPhones will be available in more than 40 additional countries on that date, and Apple expects the devices to be for sale in more than 130 countries by the end of the year.

Investors apparently expected more. Shares traded down nearly 2% Monday morning, at $112.50 in a 52-week range of $92.00 to $134.54.
