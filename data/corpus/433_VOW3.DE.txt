NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Ford Motor (F - Get Report) , along with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), is looking for ways to attract Volkswagen (VLKAY) customers as the German automaker struggles with the emissions cheating scandal, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Ford shares are gaining 2.27% to $14.64 on Wednesday afternoon.

Specifically, Ford is offering dealers incentives, including new trade-in, to get customers to pick their models, the Journal said.

So far, these incentives are being offered in Spain, Germany, France, Italy, the U.K. and in other European countries.

This action comes after German automaker Volkswagen, which dominates 25% of the car market, announced in September that 11 million of its diesel cars had the software that could be used to cheat emissions tests.

Prior to the announcement, the Obama administration said that Volkswagen broke the law by intentionally using software to evade clean air standards.

As a result, "Early indications from auctions are that dealers are more hesitant to buy the VW diesel units," said Tim Fleming, lead product analyst at KBB.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates FORD MOTOR CO as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate FORD MOTOR CO (F) a BUY. This is driven by several positive factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, good cash flow from operations, growth in earnings per share and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.
