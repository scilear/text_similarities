US stocks fell early Monday ahead of a keenly anticipated Federal Reserve meeting later this week that could result in the first interest rate hike in more than nine years.

About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 16,361.47, down 71.62 points (0.44 percent).

The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 8.21 (0.42 percent) to 1,952.84, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 16.64 (0.34 percent) at 4,805.71.

Commentators are divided in their predictions for the Fed, which has signaled it plans to lift benchmark interest rates some time in 2015.

However, that target has been complicated by stubbornly low inflation and turbulence in global financial markets sparked by a big retreat in Chinese equities. The central bank's two-day policy meeting ends Thursday.

Petroleum-related stocks fell on lower oil prices. Dow member ExxonMobil shed 1.0 percent, oil-services titan Schlumberger (Hanover: SCL.HA - news) lost 1.1 percent and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP - news) shed 1.3 percent.

Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news) rose 1.7 percent after it said pre-orders of its new iPhone 6S models were on track to best last year's record for new handsets. The tech giant unveiled the new smartphones at a product launch last week.

Solera Holdings (NYSE: SLH - news) , which provides software for the automotive and insurance industries, surged 8.8 percent on news it will be acquired by private-equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $6.5 billion.

Biopharmaceutical company Baxalta (Berlin: 9BX.BE - news) rose 2.6 percent following a Wall Street Journal report that Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news) may sweeten its unsolicited bid for Baxalta. Baxalta rejected Shire's prior bid.

Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury slipped to 2.17 percent from 2.19 percent Friday, while the 30-year fell to 2.93 percent from 2.95 percent. Bond prices and yields move inversely.
