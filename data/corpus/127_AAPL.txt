The European Union is expected to say that Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) got illegal tax breaks, with rulings on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) coming up next.

An official announcement on Starbucks and Fiat could come Wednesday, sources told the Wall Street Journal . Starbucks and Fiat might have to pay back taxes, though antitrust regulators are discussing the matter with the European Commission.

Starbucks told the Journal it was complying with regulators and followed "all relevant rules, laws and OECD guidelines."

Shares of Starbucks, down in the morning, closed up 1.5% in the stock market today. Fiat Chrysler was up 3.2%. Apple was up 1.4%, and Amazon rose 3.2%.

EU law bars member nations from giving companies preferential tax treatment. The investigations, which also target the respective tax practices of Apple and Amazon, began last year and follow years of complaints that multinationals were taking advantage of porous European laws to avoid paying taxes.

It's unclear when a ruling on Apple or Amazon might be made, but Apple said in an SEC filing that if it had to pay previously unpaid taxes to Ireland, the costs could be "material," Bloomberg reported.

U.S. multinational corporations, especially tech firms, have come under increasing scrutiny in Europe. Last week, Europe's highest court struck down an agreement allowing companies to transfer Internet users' data from the EU to the U.S., a direct blow to tech giants like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

Meanwhile, the EU has already charged Alphabet with abusing its dominance in the search market, while antitrust regulators have opened a probe into Amazon, and an investigation into Apple's music streaming is also possible.
