Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has seen a 5.52 percent gain in its share price over the past five trading days.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) has seen a 5.52 percent gain in its share price over the past five trading days. Steven Milunovich of UBS has maintained a Buy rating and price target of $150 on the company.

Milunovich expects the stock to be worth more than $200, if it were priced as an annuity business and mentions that the iPhone Upgrade Program was a “smart move.”

According to the UBS report, “Although customer use of the Upgrade Program will occur gradually, investor perception that the growth and consistency of iPhone revenue are improving should benefit the stock.”

Milunovich expects the Upgrade Program to drive customers to upgrade more often, thereby boosting the company’s revenue, even if more used phones hit the market. With this program, “the iPhone begins to look more like an annuity and less like a hits business.”

The program could drive the EPS, with the iPhone revenue becoming more sustainable, although there is unlikely to be any significant change in revenue recognition.

In addition, the program is unlikely to have any meaningful near-term impact on carriers, since it is similar to many of the installment plans offers by carriers. Longer term, however, if Apple implements a carrier lock-in, it could pressure the company’s revenue trends, “potentially squeezing the providers to a wholesale model."
