You can get the Target app at the App Store.

Now you can get the Apple Watch at the Target store.

Just in time for the holidays, the Apple Watch goes on sale today at some Target stores, begging the question: Who ever thought Target would go so upscale?

Turns out, the big-box discount king known more for well-priced pet food and cheap toilet paper is not going THAT upscale: Target will not be selling the high-end models, such as the $17,000, 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition — darn! — but rather the relatively low-end models that go for between $349 and $599.

In a corporate blog post, Target showed off photos of two of the new watches with a headline that said: “Apple Watch is Coming to Target!”

Expected to be one of the season’s hottest gift items, Apple Watch is coming to some Target stores this week and all stores by Oct. 25. Guests can choose from 20 models—in both 38mm and 42mm sizes—including beautiful space gray and rose gold colors. Select models and bands will be available at all Target stores, and an expanded assortment of Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch will be available on Target.com. Prices range from $349 to $599.

Target, which has long carried other Apple products like the iPad, will start taking online orders for the Watch on Oct. 18th. The retail giant says the models it will carry include new editions like the rose gold Sport model and the black-is-the-new-black, stainless steel Watch.

And if you’re planning on buying your Apple Watch at Target, don’t forget to pick up a bag of fertilizer, marked-down lingerie, bananas and milk.
