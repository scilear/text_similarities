New Delhi, June 9 (IANS) Apple has unveiled a new app for delivering news to users of iPhones and iPads.

The News app, which was launched at Apple's world wide developers conference (WWDC) in San Francisco, will give an innovative reading experience with the use of pictures, infographics and custom fonts and layouts.

It will be available to users with the release of iOS 9 in September-November.

According to Apple, the News app will allow users to follow over a million topics and pull relevant stories based on specific interests that can be easily shared or saved for later, without compromising on privacy.

"News seamlessly delivers the articles you want to read in a beautiful and uncluttered format, while respecting your privacy, because Apple doesn't share your personal data," said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services.

"We already have nearly 20 publishers representing more than 50 titles joining us, including Conde Nast, ESPN, The New York Times, Hearst, Time Inc., CNN and Bloomberg."

According to Bob Sauerberg, president of Conde Nast, all premium content deserves a premium mobile experience and "the News app delivers that".

"News offers an environment that combines the rich, immersive design of our photography, artwork and editorial expertise with the interactivity and dynamism of digital media."
