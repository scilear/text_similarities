General Electric Co. agreed to sell its corporate aircraft financing portfolio in the Americas to Global Jet Capital in a deal valued at roughly $2.5 billion, as the conglomerate proceeds with its plan to focus more on its industrial businesses.

GE Capital GE, +2.53% Chairman and Chief Executive Keith Sherin said Global Jet Capital is “an up-and-coming player in the corporate aircraft space” and is a “well-backed private-equity player eager to expand its corporate aircraft portfolio.”

With the corporate aircraft portfolio deal, expected to close over the next several months, GE Capital said it has announced a total of $97 billion in deals this year. The transaction is expected to contribute roughly $300 million toward GE’s dividend target of $35 billion under the divestment plan.
