Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news) on Wednesday began testing a Messenger app virtual assistant that the leading social network said goes beyond artificial intelligence programs already on the market.

The personal digital assistant -- dubbed "M" -- completes tasks along with seeking out information at the behest of users.

"Unlike other AI-based services in the market, M can actually complete tasks on your behalf," Facebook's David Marcus said in an online post.

"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news) can purchase items, get gifts delivered to your loved ones, book restaurants, travel arrangements, appointments and way more."

Marcus described the test as an early step in a journey toward building a large-scale service using the virtual assistant software.

Word of "M" came just two days after Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news) made its Cortana virtual assistant software available to users of Android mobile devices.

Cortana is Microsoft's answer to Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news) 's Siri and Google Now, which respond to voice commands on mobile devices.

The launch is part of an effort by Microsoft to expand its mobile presence despite a weak showing for its Windows Phone devices.

"The Cortana app can do most of the things Cortana does on your PC or on a Windows phone," Microsoft's Susan Hendrich said in a blog post.

"With the app, you can manage your hectic lifestyle by setting and getting reminders, searching the web on-the-go, tracking important information such as flight details, as well as starting and completing tasks across all of your devices."

A beta version of Cortana was made available on Monday to US users of Android devices, and "we are planning to roll it out to other markets," Hendrich said.
