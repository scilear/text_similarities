Form 8-K for MICROSOFT CORP

29-Sep-2015

Regulation FD Disclosure, Financial Statements and Exhibits

In June 2015, Microsoft Corporation (the "Company") announced a change in organizational structure as part of its transformation in the mobile-first, cloud-first world. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company's chief operating decision maker (its chief executive officer) changed the information he regularly reviews to allocate resources and assess performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, the Company will report its financial performance based on the three reportable segments described below, and analyze operating income as the measure of segment profitability.

We are furnishing this Form 8-K under Regulation FD to provide a description of our new reporting structure and present summary financial information and historical data on a basis consistent with the new structure. Beginning with the quarter ending September 30, 2015, our financial statements will reflect the new reporting structure with prior periods adjusted accordingly.
