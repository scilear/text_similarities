Troubled carmaker Volkswagen will launch a mass recall of almost 100,000 cars as its emissions scandal in Australia widens to include thousands more dodgy vehicles.

Volkswagen Australia announced a voluntary recall on Friday, two days after it admitted to the existence of emissions-cheating software in its Australian diesel vehicles.

On Friday it was revealed that an extra 6,444 Volkswagens and 2,057 Audi cars were affected, taking the national tally to 99,678 vehicles.

All would be subject to the voluntary recall aimed at cars carrying the EA 189 turbo diesel engines.

In a statement the Australian office said that it would write to its affected customers to let them know the steps they should take in the recall plan.

However it released no details about what repairs might be taken, and told customers to take no action until a technical solution was provided by its German head office.

"I want to assure all customers that the affected cars are technically safe and the necessary measures will be undertaken at no cost to them," Volkswagen Australia's managing director John White said.

"We will do everything we can to fix this problem and regain the trust of our customers."

Its luxury subsidiary Audi Australia also made a similar declaration.

Both brands have set up websites allowing customers to check if their vehicles are affected.

The Australian action comes a full three weeks after the German auto giant confessed to installing `defeat devices' in more than 14 million cars worldwide and a week after head office announced plans to refit and recall the engines of five million vehicles worldwide.

Volkswagen Australia has been criticised for keeping the local market in the dark in that time, and referring all queries about the scam to the global head office.

In the statement, Mr White apologised for "any disappointment and inconvenience felt by our customers, staff, dealers and partners".

The company will likely face legal action from consumers, after law firm Maurice Blackburn said on Friday that more than 2,500 Australian motorists had signed up to a potential class action claiming compensation.

Customers are concerned about resale values for vehicles and ongoing costs of repair operations.

Volkswagen is also being investigated by the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission into whether it breached consumer and safety standards under consumer law.
