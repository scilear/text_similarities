Lending: Technology Companies' New Focus

(Continued from Prior Part)

Leveraging the small business lending space

We discussed how tech companies such as Intuit (INTU), PayPal(PYPL), and Square are leveraging the small business lending space to make profits. Like Intuit and PayPal, Square is also making progress in offering loans, and since May 2014 has offered more than $225 million worth of finances to its small business customers, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.

Earlier this year in May, Square managed to get additional funding from investors, which include Victory Park Capital and Colchis Capital, to expand its operations into the lending space.

Both PayPal and Square’s lending funds program takes payments for loans from the customers as a portion of transaction volume. Merchants make bigger payments during the periods when sales are high and don’t make any payments on days when there is no sale. This method results in easier repayments and avoids the risk of default.

Competition is heating up in the payments space. PayPal and Square will need to continue to innovate, as Apple’s (AAPL) and Google’s (GOOG) competition in the mobile payments space is rising quickly. A few months ago, Google launched its revamped Android Pay mobile payment service at its I/O conference.

Apple Pay launched in the United States in October 2014. Apple has been making constant developments since then. According to Apple, more than 1 million US locations and 2,500 banks support Apple Pay. Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, Apple Watch, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3.

In the initial phase, Apple partnered with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express for the service. Visa forms ~2.50% of the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA).
