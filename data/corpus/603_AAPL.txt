NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple's (AAPL - Get Report) stock chart continues to show that shares are poised for an upward move, and today we'll look at an options trades that will profit from a rally.

On Friday, Sept. 11, we wrote that if there was a continuation of bullish signals, Apple would be a candidate for a trade. The current chart, through the close of Wednesday's session, shows that the upward momentum is continuing.

The chart offers up numerous signals. First, declining support over the last six months flipped to resistance after Aug. 24. That resistance line held until Monday, when the stock's price gapped above resistance. This was preceded by two strong three-session bullish candlestick signals. The initial reversal was a bullish abandoned baby; this was confirmed by a bullish three inside up signal.

Further confirming the likely continued bullish move was the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, shown at the bottom of the chart. Only a few weeks ago, both averages were far below the signal line, but they have been trending higher every day and are quickly approaching the signal line. Once these averages move higher, they will show that the stock is in bullish territory.
