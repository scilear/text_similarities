Microsoft has bundled the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview build with a number of major (but still experimental) features, including Skype integration. If you're an Insider on the "fast" ring, you'll notice that the messenger's capabilities are now integrated with the native Messaging, Phone and Skype video apps for the platform. You'll also be able to reply to message notifications right from the action center. More importantly, if you're having trouble activating the free Windows 10 upgrade, this build fixes that up. Simply install this particular Preview release and use a Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 product key.

In addition to integrated Skype (which will soon be rolled out the Mobile Insider Preview build, as well) and the activation fix, Microsoft has also given the new Edge browser some pretty big changes. It now shows you snapshots of a tab's contents when you hover the mouse pointer over it, and it syncs Favorites and Reading list items. Cortana, on the other hand, can now understand digitally written notes, setting alarms based on what you've scribbled, and track movies and other ticketed events via email reminders. Other new features include colored title bars, new icons and various bug fixes. Note that if you're in either Russia or Turkey, you can only access this build later this week, and if you're not an insider, well, you'll have to wait a lot longer than that.
