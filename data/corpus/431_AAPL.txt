Sprint will begin selling the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch on Friday, the same day it starts selling the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus.

Sprint (NYSE:S) is the first of the Big 4 wireless firms to give a specific date for selling the Apple watch. But John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile US (NYSE:TMUS), tweeted plans to do so earlier this month, when Apple unveiled the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus.

T-Mobile also could start selling the Apple Watch on Friday, says one report.

Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in a company press release, "We believe Apple Watch will be one of the hottest gifts for the holiday shopping season."

Apple hasn't disclosed sales figures for the Apple Watch, released in late April.

The Apple Watch has been sold at Apple's own stores as well as Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and some boutique outlets.

AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) haven't announced any plans to sell the Apple Watch. The nation's two biggest carriers have a big retail reach â€” Verizon has more than 7,000 stores while AT&T has more than 2,150, says the National Retail Federation.

Sprint expanded its retail reach earlier this year through a "store-within-a-store" agreement with struggling RadioShack . That deal involves more than 1,400 co-branded locations in the U.S.

AT&T and Verizon bulked up their retail reach through in-store deals with Best Buy, just days after Apple announced plans to offer its own financing plan for iPhone purchases.

AT&T has been playing down the threat from Apple's upgrade program, analysts say, noting that Apple has fewer than 300 U.S. stores. Only 10% to 15% of iPhones in the U.S. are sold through Apple stores.

Sprint stock was up 3% in morning trading in the stock market today.
