For all the talk of new products and services -- iPad Pro, Apple Music, and Apple Watch -- Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) primarily an iPhone-driven company, and will continue to be so for the immediate future. When it comes to the company's revenue makeup, the iPhone has grown from roughly half of Apple's haul to nearly two-thirds in less than two years. For a graphical representation of revenue, see the chart below:

As a result of both incredible iPhone growth, and struggles in non-iPhone device sales -- most notably the iPad -- Apple has become essentially a single-product company -- so much so that the company added a disclosure to the risks section in its quarterly earnings report to address its reliance on iPhone revenue.

That's not necessarily a negative, of course. As long as the company can continue to grow iPhone sales at a strong clip, investors will continue to be rewarded. And according to global information company IHS Technology, it seems Apple will continue its iPhone growth, but if the company is correct, the next two quarters may be disappointments.

IHS's data points to a slowing second half

According to the company, Apple is expected to ship 236 million iPhones this calendar year. And while that's a strong jump -- 22% over 2014's total shipments -- the data seems to point to a considerable growth slowdown from its previous torrid pace. Here's a data representation of Apple's units shipped during calendar year 2014 -- not on Apple's fiscal-quarter basis -- in order to match IHS's presentation of data:
