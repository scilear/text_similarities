Three ex-Google employees have launched a $30 PC runs on Google's mobile operating system, Android, after raising more than $1.6 million in a crowdfunding campaign to get the project going.

The Remix Mini, which fits into the palm of your hand, is being billed as the "world's first true Android PC" by Jide Technology, the company behind the project that was founded last year.

"The idea is that we want to make sure it's affordable and accessible," David Ko, one of Jide's co-founders and an ex-Googler, told CNBC by phone.

"A lot of people are using the PCs mainly for email, surfing the web, watching videos, all these can be done with mobile tech and you don't really need a big tall PC. A traditional big tall PC can cost you a few hundred dollars. In a mobile lifestyle, people are looking for flexibility."
