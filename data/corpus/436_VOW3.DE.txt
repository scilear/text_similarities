NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Washington lawmakers grilled Volkswagen's (VLKAY) U.S. CEO Michael Horn about the automaker's emissions fraud during a hearing on Capitol Hill Thursday. Horn testified under oath before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

The company and its executives are under fire in the wake of revelations that Volkswagen installed devices and software designed to fool fuel efficiency and pollution emissions tests in about 11 million diesel vehicles.

"I did not think that something like this was possible at the Volkswagen Group," Horn told lawmakers. "We have broken the trust of our customers, dealerships, and employees, as well as the public and regulators."

Horn said the company "takes full responsibility" for its actions and is '"working with all relevant authorities in a cooperative way." He also acknowledged the consequences that lie ahead for the automaker, which could include a fine of up to $18 billion from the EPA.

Volkswagen has so far set aside some $7.3 billion to cover costs associated with the scandal.

"We are conducting investigations on a worldwide scale into how these matters happened," he said. "Responsible parties will be identified and held accountable."

Horn said he was made aware of possible emission issues in summer of 2014, but only found out the vehicles contained a device to cheat on emissions tests early last month.

As for the nearly 500,000 affected cars in the U.S., most will require a major overhaul -- beyond just a simple software tweak. Horn said he's unsure when the vehicles will be fixed.

"It is important for the public to know that, as the EPA has said, these vehicles do not present a safety hazard and remain safe and legal to drive," he said.

On Wednesday, Volkswagen said it plans to begin recalling the affected cars in January.
