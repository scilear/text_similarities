NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- General Electric (GE - Get Report) shares have rallied higher since we predicted on Sept. 28 that they were poised for a breakout, but there are now signs that the stock's rally is coming to an end.

The stock closed Sept. 28 at $24.31. By Tuesday morning it had risen as high as $28.28. The stock has since fallen back from that intraday high to about $28.15, but even so, it's still up nearly 16% in about two weeks.

On Sept. 28 the recommendation was to buy call options or sell put options in anticipation of a rally. The current chart contains a warning, however. Momentum, as measured by the relative strength index, has moved into overbought territory. This is the first time since mid-April that RSI has become overbought. What's more, the upward move in the stock's price has slowed and reached a plateau.

If you did buy calls or sell puts based on that earlier recommendation, this could be the time to take profits.
