Apple reportedly made another move to bolster its Maps app, which has struggled to catch up to rival Google and its dominant mapping platform.

Let's take a look at tech stocks to watch Thursday:

Apple. The tech giant acquired MapSense, a startup that analyzes location data, reports Re/code. The report says the deal is worth as much as $30 million, and the MapSense team -- based in San Francisco -- will move to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino.

Oracle. Shares slipped more than 2.7% in morning trading after it missed revenue estimates in its first quarter results. Overall, first-quarter revenue fell 1.7% to $8.45 billion. Oracle also reported earnings of 53 cents a share, topping forecasts.

Google. The company hired several employees from Amazon's hardware research division to work on the Glass eyewear, reports The Wall Street Journal. The Amazon employees were laid off following dismal sales of the Fire phone, which has since been discontinued. The team working on Glass will go under the name Project Aura, says the report.

Adobe. The software company reports third quarter earnings after the markets close Thursday. Analysts estimate Adobe will report earnings of 50 cents a share off revenue of $1.21 billion.

Facebook. The social network is partnering with Shopify to introduce a Shop section on Facebook pages. The option will let consumers make purchases from merchants without leaving Facebook.
