Deezer's flotation plans come amid increasing competition in the music streaming space with Apple recently launching its own platform.

The French startup was founded in 2007 and said revenues surged 53 percent in 2014 to hit 142 million euros ($158.5 million). Deezer boasts 6.3 million subscribers and over 35 million tracks, but this still puts it behind some of its rivals.

Spotify for example has over 75 million active users while Apple said it had signed up 11 million trial members.

But Albrecht is convinced Deezer can stay ahead of the competition.

"It's a competitive market and there are a lot of people who want to join the race. But at the same time it's a complicated product and can't be built overnight," the chief executive told CNBC.

"We are the first pioneers in the industry, and if you look at our product, if you look at our localized content strategy, we are very well-positioned and it's not easy to catch up."
