NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Should you buy General Electric (GE - Get Report) stock now?

Investors looking at the conglomerate's daily chart can clearly see its shares spiked on April 10 after it announced plans to shed its portfolio of financial-related assets, and and on Oct. 5 when activist investor Nelson Peltzentered the picture. But in between shares saw a significant drop due to the Aug. 24 flash crash.

This extreme volatility for an industrial benchmark company and key component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) can be captured using good till canceled (GTC) limit orders to buy on weakness to a key level below the market and/or use the GTC limit orders to sell on strength to a key level above the market.

Analysts expect General Electric Intel to report earnings of 26 cents a share before the opening bell on Friday. The company's GE Capital unit is selling three financial loan portfolios valued at $30 billion to $32 billion to Wells Fargo (WFC - Get Report) . In total GE has shed about $127 billion so far in 2015 because the company wants to be removed from the U.S. Treasury's list of companies considered a "systemically important financial institution."

GE currently trades at $27.79, up 10% year to date, but the chart clearly shows that to stay with this stock during the extreme volatility has taken a lot of patience and discipline.

Back on April 10 shares of GE traded as high as $28.68 and here's how the charts looked then. Investors who entered a good till canceled limit order to sell on strength to $28.09 reduced holdings at this key level.
