It’s official, or as official as Apple gets until the secretive company one day announces its automotive ambitions at a well-choreographed tech conference: the Cupertino giant is working on self-driving cars.

Apple talked about California’s rules for autonomous vehicles last month with top officials from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency confirmed Friday, offering the clearest evidence yet of Apple’s long-rumored car project.

“DMV often meets with various companies regarding DMV operations,” said an emailed statement from DMV spokesman Armando Botello. “The Apple meeting was to review DMV’s autonomous vehicle regulations.”

Ten companies — including Google and big carmakers such as BMV, Mercedes-Benz, Honda and Tesla — already have permission from the state to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. Apple’s meeting was set up to discuss those testing rules, which were established last fall.

The Guardian first reported the news of the DMV meeting on Friday.

Documents also show Apple has set up an automotive technology headquarters off the Central Expressway in Sunnyvale, and multiple reports have shown that the company has been poaching automotive talent from Tesla and elsewhere.
