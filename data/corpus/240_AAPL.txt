Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.53% unveiled its iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models as well as a more expensive Apple TV unit during today‚Äôs event in San Francisco.

And while it seems most of the Internet was happy to forego talking about Donald Trump to spend one day talking Apple, not everyone was excited about the event.

Good luck to everyone about to start their one-day unpaid Apple marketing internship. ‚Äî pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) September 9, 2015

As the event got underway, the backlash continued with many taking aim at the Apple Pencil.

Jobs: "Let's redefine industries and change lives." Cook: "Let's make a pencil. And more color options for the watch." . #AppleEvent ‚Äî ‚òú‚ïê„ã° J!M (‚ó£Ôπè‚ó¢) (@_JMOxQ) September 9, 2015

Adobe took the stage to demo a new Photoshop app, Photoshop Fix, showing how the app can easily change a model to smile. That didn‚Äôt go over so well:

This demo is horrific, Adobe. Not the way Apple should have women on-stage. üòï ‚Äî Serenity Caldwell (@settern) September 9, 2015

The fully updated Apple TV fared much better, but still there were detractors and cynics:

You can call it Apple "TV" all you want, but I'm sorry, Apple just mic dropped their own gaming console. #AppleEvent ‚Äî Andre (BlackNerd) (@BlackNerd) September 9, 2015

As the event wrapped up, even those impressed with the new products were expressing frustration:
