Apple Inc. will begin selling the Apple Watch at Target Corp. stores, the latest third-party retailer to carry the watch.

Target TGT, +0.93% said on its website that some stores will begin selling the watch this week, with the product in all stores by Oct. 25, ahead of the key holiday sales rush. The watch will go on sale on Target.com on Oct. 18.

Only Apple’s most entry-level watches will be available at Target. The retailer said it will sell 20 models of the watch with prices ranging from $349 to $599.

After selling the Apple Watch exclusively in its own stores for several months following its April launch, Apple AAPL, +1.53% has been steadily expanding the number of retailers carrying the watch. It is a strategy that tracks Apple’s history with other new products, such as the iPad. Best Buy Co. stores began selling the watch in August, and Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. now also carry it in their stores. Many smaller third-party retailers across Europe and Asia sell the watch and other Apple products, the company said. Best Buy and Target have sold the iPad for years.

The addition of the Apple Watch to Taget’s shelves will help it regain some luster after a long slump. It has been focusing on improving its product offering in categories such as fashion and apparel that years ago earned it the moniker “Tar-zhay”.
