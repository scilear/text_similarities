Microsoft really, really wants you on Windows 10. We noticed last month that it was downloading the optional Windows 10 updater whether you asked for it (and had space for it) or not. Now it's actually pre-ticking the update box, as Ars Technica reports. That means if you're not watching closely and just hit "OK" to the latest updates, Windows Update will go ahead and install the whole shebang -- all 3GB to 6GB of it -- on your PC. While it's a worthy upgrade, there are myriad reasons that folks may not want to do that just yet, including privacy changes and the lack of a free DVD player.

While Redmond's decision to pre-tick the box seems presumptuous, the company told Ars Technica that the whole thing was, in fact, an error. "As part of our effort to bring Windows 10 to existing genuine Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 customers... (the update) option was checked as default; this was a mistake and we are removing the check." Still, it wouldn't hurt to take a peek just to make sure, or you may get a rude surprise when you return from your coffee break.
