General Electric (NYSE:GE) has unveiled Current, a subsidiary that integrates the industrial conglomerate's solar, energy-storage, electric-vehicle and light-emitting-diode businesses with its Predix platform. Several high-profile customers, such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), are early Current users.

The Fairfield, Conn.-based company said Current will begin with more than $1 billion in revenue and will build on General Electric's experience with energy and technology. Several GE customers are piloting Current to cut costs and boost energy efficiency, GE said. Users include JPMorgan Chase, Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT), Hospital Corp. of America (NYSE:HCA) and Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA).

Current will be headquartered in the Boston area with an additional presence in Silicon Valley. Roughly 200 new jobs focused on software, energy project management and outcomes selling will be created, GE said. Operations are underway and will increase next year, GE said.

General Electric shares rose 1.2% to 27.62 in the stock market today.

The news comes as engineers from Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are teaming up with colleagues from Columbia University and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, to develop a "software-defined battery." This development purportedly would allow different batteries with different chemistries to be integrated into one system.

If successful, the findings could revolutionize consumer battery technology and meet customer demands for longer battery life, quicker charging and diversified chemistry.

Tesla has expanded into battery storage for residential, business and utility-scale applications.

Tesla stock fell 3.9% to 231.96 — closing pennies above its 200-day line — amid continued concerns about the Model X price tag, while Microsoft shares rose 3 cents to 46.78.
