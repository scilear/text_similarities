Volkswagen AG diesel vehicles sold in South Africa comply with local emissions standards, the automaker’s local unit said on Monday.

South Africa uses the EU 2 emissions standard and all Volkswagen and Audi vehicles sold in the country with the EA 189 diesel engine comply with the rules for nitrogen oxide emissions, Volkswagen South Africa said in an e-mailed statement.

“Vehicles meet all the legal requirements in terms of which the National Regulator approved the sale for use in South Africa," Volkswagen said. “There is therefore no action required on either the part of the customer or our dealers."

Volkswagen admitted to rigging engines to circumvent pollution controls in the U.S., the country’s Environmental Protection Agency said Sept. 19. South Africa’s National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications said Sept. 25 that it would work with the environmental affairs and transport ministries to investigate whether Volkswagen vehicles in the country complied with emissions rules.
