Europe’s stock benchmark fell to its lowest closing level since late August on Tuesday, with car makers posting some of the biggest losses following calls for a wider probe of the industry in the wake of Volkswagen’s emission-test scandal.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +2.03% dropped 3.1% to end at 346.67, suffering its third loss in four sessions.

Richard Perry, market analyst at Hantec Markets, said there wasn’t a single factor behind the selloff, but that traders were fleeing toward haven investments due to lower oil prices and concerns over China’s upcoming manufacturing data. Global growth worries expressed by the U.S. Federal Reserve last week also lingered over the markets, he said.

“Oil prices are certainly an issue and it’s a big signal in terms of market sentiment, because the oil price reflects general global demand. So when the crude oil is down 3%, it’s going to put equities under pressure,” Perry said.

Crude oil US:CLV5 dropped more than 2% on Tuesday, and U.S. stocks showed big losses around midday in New York.

Car blues: Auto stocks were hit hard Tuesday after French Finance Minister Michel Sapin called for a probe of the entire sector in Europe.

In France, Peugeot SA UG, +2.76% slid 8.8% and Renault SA RNO, +2.85% lost 7.1%.
