NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) named James Bell, former Boeing (BA - Get Report) chief financial officer and former Boeing interim CEO, to its board, as Apple continues to revamp its leadership, post-Steve Jobs.

Bell, who helped oversee Boeing Capital and Boeing Shared Services during his 38-year career at the Seattle-based aviation company, is being brought on for his financial and strategic planning capabilities, according to a statement from Apple.

"James brings a wealth of global, financial and industrial experience from his successful career at Boeing as corporate president and CFO," Apple CEO Timothy D. Cook said in a statement." "I am thrilled to welcome him to Apple's board of directors and I look forward to working with him."

Apple's board is the fourth board on which Bell sits. He's also a member of the board of directors of JPMorgan Chase (JPM - Get Report) , Dow Chemical (DOW - Get Report) and CDW (CDW - Get Report) and he's a trustee of Chicago's Rush University Medical Center.

Since Cook took over for Jobs in the summer of 2011, Apple has reshaped its board. In July 2014, Susan Wagner, who co-founded the financial management company BlackRock (BLK) , join the board, replacing Bill Campbell, the former Intuit (INTC) CEO, who retired after 17 years.

The Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple has also shaken up its executive leadership since the death of Jobs.

Among the changes include Jony Ive, who is seen as Jobs' closest confidant, becoming the company's chief design officer. Angela Ahrendts, the former CEO of Burberry (BURBY) , is the company's senior vice president of retail and online stores. Lisa Jackson, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives. Steve Dowling is now the company's vice president of communications, having taken over for Katie Cotton.

Apple shares were down 2% in trading Thursday morning.
