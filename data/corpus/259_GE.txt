October 6, 2015: Markets opened lower on Tuesday following August’s higher-than-expected U.S. trade deficit of $48.3 billion. The Nasdaq Composite was weighed down again today by biotech weakness and little enthusiasm for the big tech stocks. Oil climbed on comments from OPEC’s chief that what goes down will also go up, and soon. WTI for November delivery settled at $48.53, up 4.9% for the day and gold rose 0.8% to settle at $1,146.40. Equities were headed for a mixed close shortly before the closing bell as the DJIA traded up 0.10% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down 0.35%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded down 0.66%.

The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Tuesday was

E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (NYSE: DD) which traded higher by 7.18% at $54.96. The stock’s 52-week range is $47.11 to $76.59. Trading volume was more than 5 times the daily average of around 6.1 million. The company’s CEO announced today that she will retire on October 16th, but the company appointed an interim CEO who started work today. Hmmm.

Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) traded up 3.58% at $87.04. The stock’s 52-week range is $69.58 to $120.17. Trading volume was about 30% above the daily average of around 11 million. The company had no specific news today, but a 5% bump in the price of crude can’t help but boost an oil company’s stock.

Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) traded up 2.36% at $70.82. The stock’s 52-week range is $62.99 to $107.12. Trading volume was about 10% above the daily average of around 7.5 million. The company had no specific news today, but rising oil prices raise prospects for sales of the company’s heavy equipment.

General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) traded up 1.96% at $27.34. The stock’s 52-week range is $19.37 to $28.68. Trading volume was more about 60% above the daily average of around 37.7 million. The stock is still getting a boost from the $2.5 billion investment made by Nelson Peltz’s Trian Management.

Of the Dow 30 stocks 15 are set to close higher today and 15 are on track to close lower.
