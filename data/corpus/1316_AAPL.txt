NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) stock is decreasing by 1.34% to $110.29 in late afternoon trading on Wednesday, after researchers announced an increase of malicious software affecting Apple's OS X operating system.

Five times more malware appeared this year than during the previous five years combined, according to an analysis of 1,400 unique OS X malware samples over 10 weeks by security vendor Bit 9 + Carbon Black, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Separate reports by Kapersky Lab and Intel (INTC) also have indicated a surge in malicious software targeting Mac OS X during the past year, the Journal adds.

Mac's OS X lacks support for many endpoint security vendors, and a number of companies have been unable to install the same security controls on Mac products as they have on Windows products, according to the Journal. Companies are consequently left unprotected from potential viruses and attacks.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook.
