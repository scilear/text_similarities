Large-cap stock funds dropped less than small- and midcap funds during the summer's stock market sell-off. That's helped large-cap funds shrink the gap in 10-year performance.

The average large-cap stock mutual fund rose an annual average of 6.96% in the past 10 years vs. 8.17% for the average midcap fund, 7.64% for small-cap funds and 6.97% for the S&P 500.

A $10,000 investment in the average large-cap mutual fund made on Sept. 30, 2005, would have climbed to $19,602 by Oct. 2 this year, according to Morningstar Inc. data. The same amount would have blossomed to $21,928 in midcap funds, $20,880 in small-cap funds and $19,623 in the S&P 500.

Top-performing large-cap mutual funds have skated well ahead of the S&P 500 in the past 10 years. They've even beaten the average small-cap fund and midcap fund.

What's more, most of the top performing big-cap funds are beating the proxy for the broad stock market this year.

JPMorgan Growth Advantage Fund has returned an average annual 10.24% in the past 10 years. It's up 3% this year vs. a 3.72% decline for the S&P 500.

The $5.5 billion large-cap growth fund has been managed by Timothy Parton since 2002.

JPMorgan Growth Advantage's recent top holdings include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (formerly Google), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Alphabet has been consolidating its gain after breaking out in mid-July. The stock is 5% off its all-time high after regaining its 50-day moving average Monday. The stock carries an IBD Composite Rating of 98. Analysts see the Internet giant's earnings rising 13% this year and 17% next year.

Facebook also has been consolidating and is 5% off the all-time high it hit in July and has also regained its 50-day line. It carries a Composite Rating of 99. Earnings are seen rising 18% this year and 33% next year.

Apple continues to run under its 50-day line. Its Composite Rating is 71. Earnings growth, which has slowed to an annual pace of 10% the past three years, is seen picking up to 42% in the current fiscal year ending in September and 7% next year.
