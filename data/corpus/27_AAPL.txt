BEIJING (AP) -- Asian stock markets were mostly higher Monday following Wall Street's gains as investors looked ahead to this week's Chinese trade data.

Seoul's Kospi added 0.1 percent to 2,022.28 and India's Sensex advanced 0.1 percent to 27,121.39. Taiwan, Singapore and New Zealand also rose.

WALL STREET: The U.S. stock market turned in its best week of the year, helped by airlines and industrial companies. The S&P 500 ended the week up 3.3 percent, its best week since mid-December. Most of the gains came after the release of last week's disappointing jobs report, which suggested the Federal Reserve would postpone a long-anticipated interest rate rise for several months. That signal was reinforced Thursday, when the minutes from the September Fed meeting showed policymakers are too concerned about low inflation and the slowdown in China to raise interest rates.

CHINA TRADE: Forecasters expect data Tuesday to show China's September imports contracted by as much as 15 percent from a year earlier in a new sign of weakness in the world's second-largest economy. Exports are expected to have declined as well due to weak global demand. The slowdown has sent shockwaves through economies that supply raw materials and components to China's vast manufacturing industry. The trade data "will be a key" for investor sentiment toward commodities and mining stocks, according to Ric Spooner of CMC Markets.

ANALYST'S TAKE: "In Asia, indicators for China's economy will be the key focal point this week," Bernard Aw of IG Markets said in a report. "The current account balance of China may stay under pressure for some time." Despite expectations Beijing wants to hold its yuan steady in hopes of having it adopted by the International Monetary Fund as part of the basket used to set the value of its in-house currency, "growth concerns and financial reforms are expected to weigh on the local currency," said Aw. He said Beijing might spend more of its foreign currency reserves to hold the yuan steady, "which may add to market volatility."
