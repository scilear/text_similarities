Research firms can't agree on exact number of Mac computer sold in third quarter, but can agree that shipments have slowed to lowest rate in two years.

Sales of Apple computers took a dive in the third quarter, but the tech giant still outperformed other PC makers, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Research firms International Data Corp. and Gartner don't agree on actual sales figures, but they do say Mac sales slowed to their lowest rate since the third quarter of 2013, the paper said.



Gartner estimates Apple's Mac sales contracted by 1.5 percent, while IDC says the slow-down was more drastic at 3.4 percent.

The slowdown came as the overall PC market shrank by 11 percent in the third quarter, according to IDC. Apple's share in the PC market grew, however, because other companies fared worse during the quarter.
