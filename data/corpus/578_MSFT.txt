New Delhi, July 31 (IANS) Over 14 million devices were running Windows 10 operating software, 24 hours after its launch, Microsoft said in a Windows blog post.

"As we've shared, our top priority has been ensuring that everyone has a great upgrade experience, so, we are carefully rolling out Windows 10 in phases, delivering Windows 10 first to our Windows Insiders," Yusuf Mehedi, Microsoft corporate vice-president for Windows and Devices Group, wrote in a blog post.

"While we now have more than 14 million devices running Windows 10, we still have many more upgrades to go before we catch up to each of you that reserved your upgrade."

"We have seen unprecedented demand for Windows 10, with reviews and customer feedback overwhelmingly positive around the globe. We are doing everything we can to upgrade the world to Windows 10 as quickly as possible over the coming days and weeks ahead," he added.

Mehedi also said that Microsoft was working 24x7 to get the free updates rolling and alluded that a copy would land in the user's device if they had earlier registered for an update.
