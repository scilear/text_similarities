The Pope isn't the only one taking New York by storm. Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6s and 6s Plus hit stores on Thursday. At Apple's 14th Street store in New York City, hundreds of people lined up to get their hands on the latest gadgets. Some waited over 10 hours. But people used to wait days for the latest iPhone, not hours. Some customers who waited for the device told TheStreet that the hype surrounding the phone may be fading. But sales are still pretty healthy. Apple is expected to sell 236 million iPhones in 2015 - a 22 percent increase from last year, according to HIS. Analysts say thatâ€™s largely on the heels of the phone's growing popularity in China. According to Apple's most recent earnings report back in July, the company sold 47.5 million iPhones during its fiscal third quarter - but that didn't 'wow' investors. Analysts were expecting roughly 50 million. For now, Apple is banking on the iPhone, since other devices like the Apple Watch and iPad have yet to see the explosive growth Apple is accustomed to. TheStreet's Scott Gamm reports from the Apple Store in New York.
