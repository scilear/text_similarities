The stock market erased small gains and was modestly lower in early afternoon trading Tuesday. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were down 0.2% each, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1%.

Volume was tracking higher â€” no surprise after Monday's Columbus Day slowdown. Declining stocks led advancers by a 7-to-5 ratio on the NYSE, and by 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq.

Among widely held stocks, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was slightly lower after the bank agreed to acquire GE Capital's lending and leasing business, which total $32 billion in assets. General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares were nearly flat.

A smattering of medical, media, Internet and cyclical stocks led the stock market today.

UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH)climbed 2% in heavy volume. The HMO is nearing the 126.31 buy point of its base, but topped an alternative entry at 125.22.

Weakness in airlines, railroads, trucking and air freight made the transportation sector the day's weakest. The Dow transportation average tumbled 1.6%.

JPMorgan downgraded JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) to neutral from overweight. The stock slid 7% but may be finding support at the 50-day moving average. Also, Evercore ISI downgraded both American Airlines (NYSE:AA) (NYSE:L) and Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) to hold. American pared losses to less than 1%, while Alaska Air was down 3% and trading below its 50-day moving average.

Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) reports third-quarter results Wednesday morning. Analysts expect a profit of $1.71 a share, up 42%. Shares remain near the 48.40 buy point, which Delta topped Monday.

One day after it broke out of a base, Skywest (NASDAQ:SKYW) sank right back into its pattern, falling 9% in heavy trading.
