TSMC Reports Fall in Fiscal 3Q15 EPS, the First since 2012

TSMC’s fiscal 3Q15 earnings review

On October 15, 2015, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (or TSMC) (TSM) announced its fiscal 3Q15 results. The company generated a great deal of news since this is the first time since 2012 the company has reported a fall in quarterly earnings.

In fiscal 3Q15, TSMC reported revenues of New Taiwanese $212.5 billion and New Taiwanese $2.91 per share, respectively.

On sequential and year-over-year (or YoY) bases, TSMC revenues grew 1.7% and 3.4%, respectively. However, its EPS fell 1.3% and 5.1% on quarter-over-quarter (or QoQ) and YoY bases, respectively.

A strong dollar (UUP) helped TSMC post above its original guidance of New Taiwanese $211–$213 billion. TSMC reported a net profit of New Taiwanese $75.3 billion against consensus estimates of New Taiwanese $72.4 billion. So unlike other companies in the technology space, strengthening of the US dollar helped TSMC report growth, as a majority of its sales are denominated in US dollars.

Slowdown as well as maturity in the Chinese economy impacted smartphone sector

IDC (International Data Corporation) stated that global smartphone shipments, which grew by 27.5% in 2014, are expected to increase by only 10.4% in 2015. It’s been reported that this expected 10% growth is not likely to help the semiconductor industry, as there’s already a large inventory buildup.

A major reason for the slowdown in the smartphone market is the slowdown in the Chinese economy. Although China is still the largest market for smartphones, its share in the smartphone market is likely to reduce in the coming years. In 2015, China’s smartphone shipments are expected to grow by only 1.2% compared to 19.7% in 2014. India (EPI) is considered a high growth market, whose expansion would lead to a drop in China’s overall share in the smartphone space.

Samsung (SSNLF), with 21.4% market share, is a leader in the global smartphone market. It’s followed by Apple (AAPL) with ~14% share.
