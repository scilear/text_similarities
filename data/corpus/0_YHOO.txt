Be advised that the earnings and revenue estimates may change ahead of the formal reports, and some companies may change reporting dates as well.

Yahoo

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) will share its most recent quarterly results on Tuesday. The consensus estimates call for earnings per share (EPS) of $0.17 and $1.26 billion in revenue. This company has continued to report so-so quarters, and some investors are starting to tire of Marissa Mayer’s stint as the chief executive, as the stock is down almost 40% since last November. Yahoo provides search and display advertising services on Yahoo properties and affiliate sites worldwide. The company’s revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 6.7%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 14.7%, and although the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.04 is very low, it is currently higher than that of the industry average.

Shares traded at $33.37 on the close on Friday, in a 52-week trading range of $27.20 to $52.62. The stock has a consensus analyst price target of $45.03.

Biogen

Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) is scheduled to reveal its third-quarter results on Wednesday. The consensus estimates call for $3.81 in EPS, as well as $2.64 billion in revenue. It is the second big biotech company to announce a gigantic debt offering recently. Biogen shares got absolutely hammered in the summer when it reported second-quarter earnings that were far below Wall Street estimates. The stock dropped 22% mainly because the biotech giant substantially reduced its full-year 2015 outlook. Biogen’s blockbuster drug Tecfidera registered much-lower-than-expected revenue growth, resulting in the low full-year 2015 guidance.

Shares were trading at $272.37 on Friday’s close. The consensus price target is $383.07. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $254.00 to $480.18.

GM

General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) is set to report its third-quarter results on Wednesday. The analysts’ consensus estimates call for EPS of $1.18 and $38.58 billion in revenue. The company recently posted total September U.S. sales of 251,310 vehicles, an increase of 12.5% compared with September 2014. Retail deliveries rose 17.3%, fleet deliveries fell 3.3% and commercial sales rose 10% in September. Fleet sales of pickup trucks have increased year over year in 17 consecutive months. Total fleet deliveries for the year to date were down 5%, primarily on planned reduced sales to rental customers.

Shares were changing hands at $33.14 Friday session concluded. The consensus price target is $39.93, and the stock has a 52-week trading range of $24.62 to $38.99.

Amazon

Look for Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) to report its third-quarter results on Thursday. The consensus analyst estimates call for a net loss of $0.13 per share and revenue of $24.91 billion. This company is the absolute leader in online retail, and it is also a dominate player in cloud storage business, serving developers and enterprises through Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides compute, storage, database, analytics, applications and deployment services that enable virtually various businesses.

Shares of Amazon ended last week at $570.76. The consensus price target is $648.16. The 52-week trading range is $284.00 to $580.57.

Alphabet

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is expected to share its latest quarterly earnings on Thursday. The consensus estimates call for $7.20 in EPS and $18.53 billion in revenue. This will be an incredibly difficult earnings report to decipher after the restructuring that took place in the split of Alphabet and Google. Be on the lookout for incoming analyst reports about where this company is headed.

Shares were at $695.32 on Friday’s close, in a 52-week trading range of $490.91 to $713.33. The stock has a consensus analyst price target of $774.39.

Under Armour

Under Armour Inc. (NYSE: UA) also will share its most recent quarterly results on Thursday. The analysts’ consensus estimates call for EPS of $0.44 and $1.18 billion in revenue. According to Merrill Lynch, Under Armour’s Investor Day reiterated its powerful top-line outlook, with revenue now expected to reach $7.5 billion by 2018 from $3.1 billion in 2014, and compared to the firm’s prior forecast of $6.8 billion. The 25% revenue compound average growth rate will be fueled by roughly 50% international growth and 40% growth in footwear. Earnings are expected to grow slightly below sales, as Under Armour makes investments in new categories/geographies, innovation, infrastructure, personnel and connected fitness to drive long-term growth.

Shares of Under Armour were changing hands at $100.08 as last week’s trading came to a close. The consensus price target is $108.04, and the stock has a 52-week trading range of $61.82 to $105.89.
