The iPhone’s ability to draw crowds of eager buyers is undiminished, as sales of two modestly improved models illustrated this past weekend.

Apple reported Monday a record 13 million in sales of its new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models in the first three days after launch.

Tim Cook, the company’s CEO, said sales of the new smartphones “have been phenomenal” and are “blowing past any previous first weekend sales results in Apple’s history.”

There’s an asterisk next to the record. Last year’s iPhone 6 first-weekend sales report did not include sales in China and this report does. Previous first-weekend sales totaled 10 million.

But Daniel Ives of FBR Capital Markets said FBR estimates that even without China sales, the 6s beat out last year’s sales by 5 percent to 10 percent. “The company continues to defy skeptics as they deliver a home run,” Ives said.

The 6s features improvements to the 6, including 3D touch, which senses pressure variations on the display; a 12 megapixel camera that takes “live” photos that include a few extra video-like frames for each shot; greater battery life; and a “rose gold” case.

The phone rolls out in 40 more countries Oct. 9 and will be available in more than 130 countries by the end of the year, Apple said.
