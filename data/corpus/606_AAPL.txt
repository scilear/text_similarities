NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) stock is up by 1.48% to $15.04 in pre-market trading on Thursday, after the carmaker reached a tentative contract agreement with the United Auto Workers union.

The union had stopped negotiations on Tuesday and had notified Fiat Chrysler of a strike.

The proposed four-year contract will be voted on Friday and the terms will be released after the vote.

"We heard from our members, and went back to FCA to strengthen their contract," UAW President Dennis Williams said in a statement. "We've reached a proposed tentative agreement that I believe addresses our members' principal concerns about their jobs and their futures."

The previous agreement was rejected last month because workers were against the two-tier wage and benefit system, Reuters reports.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results.
