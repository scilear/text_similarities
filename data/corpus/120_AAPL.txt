Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Tuesday gave its desktop computer lineup a refresh with ultra-high-definition 4K and 5K displays. Apple updated its entire iMac family and started selling the new computers in its stores, online and through select resellers.

The new iMacs feature more powerful processors and graphics as well as redesigned keyboards, mice and track pads.

The 21.5-inch iMac is available in three models starting at $1,099, $1,299 and, with a Retina 4K display, $1,499.

The 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display comes in three models starting at $1,799, $1,999 and $2,299.

Every new iMac comes standard with the new Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2, and customers can order the new Magic Trackpad 2 as an option. The wireless accessories were redesigned to be more comfortable and now have rechargeable batteries.

The 4K display on the high-end 21.5-inch iMac features 9.4 million pixels, 4.5 times more than the standard 21.5-inch iMac display. The 5K display on the 27-inch iMac has 14.7 million pixels, 7 times more pixels than an HD display, Apple said in a press release.

"Overall, we view the updates as a slight positive and believe that Apple will continue to gain share despite muted PC market dynamics," RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research report Tuesday. He rates Apple stock outperform, with a price target of 150.

Apple stock was up a fraction near 112 in midday trading on the stock market today.

Apple left the iMac refresh out of its overstuffed fall product launch event on Sept. 9. That event featured the debut of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, the iPad Pro and the fourth-generation Apple TV, among other announcements.

Apple continues to outperform the overall PC market.

Market research firm Gartner (NYSE:IT) last week said Apple's global PC shipments rose 1.5% year over year in the third quarter, while the overall market shrank 7.7%. Rival research firm IDC said Apple's global PC shipments fell 3.4%, while the overall market dropped 10.8%.
