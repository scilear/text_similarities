OK Related Issuers GE Capital International Funding Company General Electric Capital Corporation General Electric Company Related Research Credit Opinion: General Electric Company Credit Opinion: General Electric Capital Corporation Issuer Comment: GE Capital's $32 Billion Portfolio Sale to Wells Fargo Is Credit Positive Issuer Comment: Debt Exchange Accelerates GE Capital's Debt Repayments, a Credit Positive Rating Action: Moody's upgrades to A1 GE Capital's subordinated notes due September 2035 Rating Action: Moody's assigns A1 rating to GE Capital International Funding Company's exchange notes Global Credit Research - 21 Sep 2015 New York, September 21, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Services assigned an A1 rating with a stable outlook to the notes to be issued by GE Capital International Funding Company in exchange for certain outstanding debt of General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC; A1/Prime-1 stable). The ratings of GECC and General Electric Company (GE; A1/Prime-1 stable) are not affected by the new rating assignment. RATINGS RATIONALE The A1 rating assigned to the exchange notes is based on the unconditional and irrevocable guarantees provided by GE and GECC. The issuer is a newly formed finance subsidiary of GECC that, through a reorganization expected to occur later this year, will become a subsidiary of GE Capital International Holdings (Holdings), a new entity that will hold GECC's international businesses. As part of the reorganization, GECC will merge into GE and GECC's guarantee obligation will be assumed by Holdings. GE's guarantee of the notes, which meets Moody's criteria for full credit substitution, will not be affected by this pending reorganization. The new notes could total as much as $30 billion, depending upon the participation of eligible holders of the over 100 GECC notes totaling approximately $100 billion that are targeted for exchange. The exchange offer is a component of GE's plan to downsize GECC by divesting non-core businesses and reorganize retained businesses into new US and international holding companies. An objective of the exchange is to capitalize Holdings with a combination of debt and equity that is expected to be acceptable to the entity's European regulators. As a result of the downsizing and reorganization, GE expects to seek a reversal of GECC's SIFI designation (systemically important financial institution) from the US Treasury Department's Financial Stability Oversight Council. The exchange will facilitate a more rapid reduction in GECC's total indebtedness, in line with the accelerated pace of the company's asset sales. All holders participating in the exchange have a par-for-par exchange option, while holders of certain debt can elect a market value option that, depending on the GECC notes tendered, includes exchange notes with a maturity of six months, five years, ten years or twenty years. Priority is given to filling the six month maturity bucket, capped at $15 billion, which would accelerate GECC's consolidated debt repayments compared to its currently scheduled maturities. GECC debt either not eligible for the exchange or eligible but not tendered will remain obligations of GECC, unconditionally guaranteed by GE, until assumed by GE as part of the reorganization. GECC's ratings incorporate its significant downsizing, the franchise positioning and operating strength of its retained businesses, and the parental support of GE, which guarantees existing tradable senior and subordinate GECC debt. GECC's contribution to GE's consolidated earnings will eventually decline to 10%, down from 42% in 2014. GECC's continuing businesses include aircraft financier GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), Energy Financial Services (EFS), and Healthcare Equipment Finance, which leverage the expertise of GE's industrial businesses. GECC will have a smaller risk footprint and significantly reduced reliance on the capital markets to fund its operations, but increased asset concentration and potentially higher earnings volatility. Moody's expects the company to maintain strong liquidity and to rebuild capital ratios during the course of its transformation. An upgrade in GE Capital's ratings is not anticipated. A downgrade could result from a weakening of liquidity or a material increase in leverage, a decline in profitability or reversal of asset quality improvements for a sustained period of time, or a downgrade of GE's ratings. The principal methodology used in these ratings was Finance Company Global Rating Methodology published in March 2012. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology. REGULATORY DISCLOSURES For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's rating practices.

For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would have affected the rating.
