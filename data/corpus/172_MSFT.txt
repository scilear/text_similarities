Consumer adoption of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows 10 is growing steadily, with the software running nearly 7% of PCs on the Internet after two months on the market.

Windows 10 had 6.6% market share of PCs online in September, Net Applications reported Thursday. That's up from 5.2% in August. Microsoft released the personal computer operating system on July 29.

Microsoft is offering Windows 10 as a free upgrade for one year to owners of Windows 7 and Windows 8 PCs. (Microsoft skipped Windows 9 in its naming scheme.) It also is being sold installed on new PCs.

But with PC sales declining, most of the gains for Windows 10 likely are coming from free upgrades.

The percentage of PCs running Windows 8 dipped to 13.3% in September, compared with 14% in August and 15.9% in July.

Windows 7 remained the dominant PC operating system in use worldwide, with 56.5% market share, down from 57.7% in August and 60.7% in July.

Microsoft's Windows operating system family ran 90.5% of PCs on the Internet last month. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Mac operating system was second, with 7.7% market share, Net Applications said.

In the mobile device market, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system had 53.5% market share, followed by Apple's iOS with 38.6%. Microsoft's Windows smartphone OS is a distant third, with 2.5% market share, Net Applications said.
