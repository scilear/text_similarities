The S&P 500 is eyeing a sizable 3% gain for the week, zinc has suddenly soared and the Cubs might even have a shot at winning it all.

You predicted all of this, right?

Whether you saw it coming or not, plenty of market watchers are warning against getting too impressed by the latest market action, lest your hopes get dashed — like those of every Cubs fan since 1908.

Yes, the S&P SPX, +1.66% closed above 2,000 and its 50-day moving average on Thursday. Yes, the Dow DJIA, +1.87% clambered back over 17,000 and nabbed its longest win streak of the year.

But chart lovers here and there have been saying 2,020 could be the more important level for the S&P. Brenda Kelly, head analyst at London Capital Group, says a move above 2,020 would signal further gains, as she notes the benchmark is trying to break out of a double-bottom pattern:

And there’s a skeptical tone to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s latest “Flow Show” missive. BAML analysts argue the recent “big risk rally” has been driven primarily by “short-covering rather than fresh risk-on,” citing a $4.3 billion weekly outflow from stock funds as they make their case.

The backdrop for this is a jump in individual investor optimism to its highest level since March, according to the latest AAII Sentiment Survey. Contrarians often get worried when retail investors feel increasingly bullish. More on the AAII’s survey in the chart of the day.

Meanwhile, zinc prices have been up around 9% in London, trying for their biggest one-day gain in years, as the world’s largest miner of the metal, Glencore GLEN, +2.35% announced huge zinc production cuts. Yet Goldman Sachs isn’t impressed and remains bearish on metals. Details in our call of the day.

The buzz
