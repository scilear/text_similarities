SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) stock shot up 12% in late trade Tuesday on reports it is putting itself up for sale. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) are seen as possible buyers. The buzz comes as chip M&A activity has heated up, with some major deals.

SanDisk, which has struggled in the past two years as sales to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have waned, has hired a bank to advise on a possible sale, sources told Bloomberg, which initially reported the story. Flash memory rival Micron Technology and hard drive maker Western Digital are said to be in talks.

SanDisk had a market cap of $12.6 billion as of Tuesday's close, though the big stock rise late Tuesday suggests investors expect a higher price in an actual deal.

In June, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced a $16.7 billion deal to buy programmable logic chipmaker Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR). In May, Apple chip supplier Avago Technologies (NASDAQ:AVGO) said it would pay $37 billion for Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM). The Avago-Broadcom deal was the largest tech takeover until this week's Dell $67 billion deal to acquire EMC Corp. (NYSE:EMC).

SanDisk faces stiff competition from Samsung, which is one of the largest producers and users of memory chips. Chipmakers in general face pressure from hardware giants such as Apple and Samsung. Mergers are a way to build scale to lower prices, and perhaps gain some pricing power.

Meanwhile Micron and Intel are working on next-generation storage tech that could be much better than flash. Intel earningstopped forecasts late Tuesday.

Western Digital, which may want to broaden its storage product line, recently sold a 15% stake to Chinese state-run Unisplendour for $3.8 billion, giving the company more funds to make deals.

SanDisk operates a plant with Toshiba, which may have to sign off on any deal.
