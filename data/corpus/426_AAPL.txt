Boeing (NYSE:BA) is making a big push in one of the fastest-growing aerospace markets, with a plan to open a new 737 plant in China, as the country's president visits the U.S.

Pope Francis isn't the only foreign dignitary in America this week. China's Xi Jinping visited a Boeing facility near Seattle as part of his visit to meet business and technology leaders in the region. Xi also attended a roundtable with officials from Boeing, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).

Boeing will sell 300 aircraft to three Chinese firms and open a plant in China that will put the finishing touches on 737 jets â€” its first plant overseas as it looks to stay competitive in the region vs. European rival Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY). Airbus has already assembled over 200 jets in a factory near Beijing and is building a plant for its A330 work there.

China accounts for nearly a quarterly of Boeing's single-aisle jet deliveries this year. Airbus has been expanding in that market.

Boeing shares fell 1.7% to close at 131.67 in the stock market today.

Boeing sees demand for 6,020 new planes, valued at $870 billion, over the next two decades in China, accounting for 45% of total demand for airplanes in the region.

China is also the home to many budding low-cost carriers, as Beijing lifted restrictions on creating new airlines earlier this year.

U.S. workers are concerned about job losses at home as Boeing looks toward China, but Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said there wouldn't be any job cuts back home, according to Reuters.

Boeing isn't the only American industrial giant heading overseas. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Joy Global (NYSE:JOY) already have plants in China, and General Electric (NYSE:GE) is moving some of its power turbine work to China, which it says is due to the expiration of the Export-Import Bank's charter.

GE shares were flat.
