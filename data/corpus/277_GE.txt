Rating Action: Moody's assigns definitive ratings to Proserv; outlook changed to negative New Issue: Proserv Midco Inc. (Proserv) Rating Action: Moody's downgrades Proserv to Caa1; outlook negative Global Credit Research - 29 Sep 2015 London, 29 September 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service, ("Moody's") has today downgraded Proserv Global Inc.'s (Proserv or the company) corporate family rating (CFR) to Caa1 from B3 and probability of default rating (PDR) to Caa1-PD from B3-PD. Concurrently, Moody's has also downgraded to Caa1 from B2 the ratings on the USD135 million first lien term loan and the USD60 million first lien revolving credit facility at Proserv Operations Limited, and the USD230 million first lien term loan at Proserv US LLC as well as to Caa3 from Caa2 the rating on the USD115 million second lien term loan at Proserv US LLC. The rating outlook remains negative. RATINGS RATIONALE Today's rating action reflects Moody's expectation that Proserv's credit metrics will no longer remain commensurate with a B3 CFR for an extended period of time as Moody's anticipates the company's Moody's-adjusted debt/EBITDA could rise above 10.0x by year-end 2015 compared to 6.6x at year-end 2014, which exceeds the indicated 7.0x level for potential downgrade pressure on the B3 CFR. The expected increase in leverage is due to deteriorating operating performance resulting from pricing pressures and project deferrals across all business lines and regions with limited prospects for a recovery in market conditions in 2016. Because crude prices are likely to remain volatile and rise minimally through 2017, Moody's expects upstream offshore investments to continue at a reduced level as oil producers re-align their respective cost structures to manage through a protracted period of low and uncertain commodity prices. Most producers will defer high-cost exploration, appraisal and early-stage development projects. Moreover, Proserv competes with a variety of companies -- some of which are also customers and suppliers depending on the segment and/or geography -- including larger oilfield services companies with stronger financial profile such as Cameron International Corporation (Baa1, Ratings under Review for Upgrade), FMC Technologies, Inc (Baa2 stable), and GE Oil & Gas (part of General Electric Company rated A1 stable) and hence, have generally a superior ability to withstand pricing pressures and persistently weak market conditions. As of 30 June 2015, the company has cash balances of approximately USD21 million and approximately USD42 million available under its revolving credit facility (RCF) maturing in December 2019, the rest being used to issue guarantees and performance bonds. Moody's believes that the company's ability to fully access its RCF could become increasingly constrained over the coming quarters as the facility's single first lien leverage covenant will step down from 6x to 5x from April 2016. On the other hand, the covenant is only tested when the RCF is used above 35% excluding up to USD25 million for performance bonds and guarantees issued. In other words, the company can draw and/or issue guarantees or performance bonds under the RCF for up to USD21 million in addition to up to USD25 million of performance bonds and guarantees without triggering a covenant test. Furthermore, the company has no material debt maturities before December 2021. The rating is also supported by the company's leading positions in selected product categories, its expanding product offering, and its good geographic and customer diversity. OUTLOOK The negative outlook reflects the limited visibility for a potential stabilization of credit metrics over the next 12 to 18 months. WHAT COULD CHANGE THE RATING UP/DOWN Moody's could downgrade the ratings in the event of further deterioration in operating performance in 2016 and/or weakening liquidity position including negative free cash flow and limited access to the RCF. Moody's could consider changing the outlook to stable if operating performance starts recovering sustainably over the next 12 to 18 months. Over time, there could be positive pressure if Moody's-adjusted debt/EBITDA ratio falls to below 7.0x on a sustained basis whilst generating positive free cash flow and keeping a solid liquidity profile. Any potential upgrade would also include an assessment of market conditions.
