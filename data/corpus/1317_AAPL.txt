NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- After dividends? You're in luck. Major companies are paying out more today than they have in a decade.

According to data from FactSet, the companies of the S&P 500 paid out a total $105 billion in dividends in the second quarter (ending on July 31), marking the ninth consecutive quarter of an increase in dividends and the fifth consecutive quarter that dividend payments hit a new high. In the 12 months leading up to the end of the period, S&P companies distributed a combined $399.3 billion, marking a decade-long peak.

All sectors have exceeded their 10-year averages in aggregate dividend payments over the past year, though some have done better than others. Leading the way are financials and technology, which distributed $67.7 billion and $59.9 billion, respectively, within a 12-month period. Financials have also experienced especially notable dividends-per-share growth, up 17.3%, as have consumer discretionary, with a 21.3% increase.

But the dividend party may not last forever. The number of S&P 500 companies paying a dividend dropped to 418 at the end of July from 420 at the end of April, and the count of firms increasing their dividend fell as well to 316 from 331.

FactSet also pointed out that dividend payout ratio has been rising as dividends outpace earnings. "Looking forward, this trend may continue as analysts are projecting larger growth rates for dividends per share than they are projecting for earnings per share over the next twelve months," wrote analyst Andrew Birstingl in a report. The scenario could push some firms to reevaluate the size of their distributions.

In the meantime, it's a dividend-collector's feast. Here are the 10 S&P 500 companies that have spent the most on dividends over the past year (the 12 months leading up to Sept. 30, 2015).
