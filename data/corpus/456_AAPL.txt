Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock appears to have limited downside risk after taking a slide this summer, but the company's December quarter guidance could disappoint investors, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a report Monday.

Apple's September quarter results are likely to be in line with consensus expectations, but the December quarter targets appear too optimistic, Hargreaves said. Apple will report financial results for its fiscal fourth-quarter ended Sept. 26 on Oct. 27.

Hargreaves raised his fiscal Q1 iPhone unit sales estimate to 66.9 million from 62.4 million, which is below the consensus forecast for 76 million units, he said. Apple is likely to guide fiscal first-quarter sales lower than Wall Street views as it resets expectations for smartphone sales after the launch of the iPhone 6S series, Hargreaves said.

The iPhone 6S faces difficult comparisons to the monster debut of the iPhone 6 series a year ago.

"Despite our concern about near-term iPhone units, the extraordinary stickiness of Apple's iOS platform and its ongoing cash-return program are likely to limit multiple contraction from current levels, which should limit downside," Hargreaves said.

Hargreaves rates Apple stock as sector weight with a 12-month fair value of 132. Apple shares were up a fraction to above 111 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.

Also Monday, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva cut its iPhone sales estimate for the September quarter. Suva cut his fiscal Q4 iPhone unit sales estimate to 47 million from 48 million. He reiterated his buy rating on Apple with a price target of 145.

For fiscal Q4, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Apple to earn $1.88 a share, up 32% year over year, on sales of $51.06 billion, up 21%.

For Q1, Wall Street is modeling for Apple to earn $3.19 a share, up 4% year over year, on sales of $76.80 billion, up 3%.
