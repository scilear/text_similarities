Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates MICROSOFT CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate MICROSOFT CORP (MSFT) a BUY. This is driven by a few notable strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its reasonable valuation levels, expanding profit margins, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.
