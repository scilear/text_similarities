I'm adding shorts of Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) to my Best Ideas list this morning. (I'll be adding other stocks next week.)

I've discussed, analyzed and written about both companies a lot already, but here's my current take on each:

Apple

Arguably, Apple is the most popular stock in the universe -- and AAPL's greatest headwind is its past success (and the law of large numbers).

From a critical standpoint, Apple's recent iPhone upgrade likely represents the last important smart-phone product-cycle for some time (size matters!). And it's growing clear that Apple TV, Apple Pay and the Apple Watch won't produce a meaningful incremental impact on AAPL's sales and profits. Meanwhile Apple Mac sales growth is slowing rapidly (check out this Wall Street Journal article).

True, several analysts boosted their Apple outlooks this week, in part because of a new financing scheme. But the stock is moribund in my view.

As I've suggested in the past, Apple's shares might prove to be an "ATM" in a more-meaningful market correction. The shares are "overowned" and the bull case is known but might be coming to a close. After all, who's left to buy?

Finally, the market rotation that's been so conspicuous this week out of past leaders like Apple and into previous laggards could have some legs to it.

Tesla

Stated simply, Tesla is wildly overvalued. You can go through the archives to follow my past analysis (or check out these items here and here.)

I have no intention of shorting Tesla's shares given the high short-interest ratio (which doesn't pass my litmus test). But I'll be buying out-of-the-money TSLA puts.

The bottom line: Peak Apple! Peak Tesla!
