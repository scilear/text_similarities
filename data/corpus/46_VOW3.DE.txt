The head of Volkswagen's (VLKAY) U.S. branch testified before a House committee today, saying the emissions scandal "was not a corporate decision." Michael Horn, president and chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said he became aware of possible emissions trouble early last year, but didn't know about the involvement of software designed to evade emissions standards until last month.

"It was a couple of software engineers that put this in for whatever reasons. From my understanding, this was not a corporate decision, this was something a few individuals did," Horn said Thursday before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

The scandal affects as many as 11 million Volkswagen vehicles worldwide and could cost the company $7.3 billion in damage.

Vehicles affected by the Environmental Protection Agency are identified in the table below:
