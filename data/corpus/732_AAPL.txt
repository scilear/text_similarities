Using the power of its online marketplace to bruise its Silicon Valley tech rivals, Amazon said it plans to stop selling video-streaming devices from Google and Apple by the end of the month.

“Over the last three years, Prime Video has become an important part of (Amazon) Prime,” the Seattle-based online retail giant said in a statement Thursday. “It’s important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion. Roku, XBOX, PlayStation and (Amazon’s own) Fire TV are excellent choices.”

But not Google’s Chromecast or Apple TV, which will be banned from Amazon’s website on Oct. 29.

Bloomberg first reported the news Thursday, citing an email Amazon sent to marketplace sellers.

Google and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment, but a source confirmed that Amazon’s ban of the products will be global and affect the tech giants as well as other distributors who want to sell their products.

Google just this week announced a next generation version of Chromecast, and Apple did the same with its own TV gadget in early September.
