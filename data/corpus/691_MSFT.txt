Toshiba has unveiled the DynaPad, a 12-inch, Suface-pro like convertible that packs an exotic Wacom Active Electrostatics TruPen stylus. Microsoft revealed the news on its Windows blog, where it's been keen to promote third-party Windows 10 hardware after launching its own Surface Book. Toshiba says the stylus' 2,048 levels of pressure and specially coated 1,920 x 1,280 3:2 IPS screen help artists feel like they're "writing on paper with a real pen." However, the DynaPad's performance may disappoint artists familiar with the Surface Pro, as it's limited to a 1.44GHz Intel Atom CPU and 4GB of memory.

In exchange for lightweight performance, you do get a very lightweight and thin device, though. It weighs in at just 569 grams (1.3 pounds) or 996 grams with the keyboard (2.2 pounds), making it the lightest 12-inch 2-in-1 in the world, according to Toshiba. It's also a mere 6.6/14.9 millimeters thick with and without the keyboard. So, if you're more interested in portability than power, it's coming to Japan for Â¥130,000 ($1,080) in December, and will arrive in the US and Europe by early 2016.
