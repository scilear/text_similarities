NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) shares are declining 0.43% to $111.63 on Monday, reflecting the volatility of the broader market and investor attitudes, CNBC.com reports.

Overall, the stock is doing well but it's seeing its worst performance in six years, CNBC.com noted.

This is likely due to worries about new Apple watch sales, and the Apple car completion, according to Manhattan Venture Partners' Chief Economist Maxx Wolff.

Additionally, Apple shares usually fall before its earnings release. The tech giant is scheduled to report its third quarter financial data on October 27. Analysts believe investor worries will ease and the stock will get stronger afterwards, CNBC.com said.

However, reaching its all-time peak of $135 appears unlikely, Susquehanna's Senior Options Trader Stacey Gilbert pointed out.

"I can remember talking about how it's going to be the next trillion-dollar company," Gilbert said. "Now we're kind of talking about how disappointed we are in the year-to-date performance."

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook.
