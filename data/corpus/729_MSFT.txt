Disney is looking for an intern who can help develop counter threat plans and ward off terrorist and cyberattacks.

To help the House of Mouse’s DIS, +2.87% intelligence and counterterrorism team, the intern must be proficient with Microsoft Office MSFT, +1.76% products and make “effective use of the open source and the Internet resources,” according to the job posting.

The corporate intern would join Disney’s team that “provides strategic intelligence, threat assessments, vulnerability mitigation strategies and in-depth analytical products covering existing and developing threats that include counter terrorism, physical threats, cyberattacks and all reputation risks to The Walt Disney Company,” the posting says.

It’s no surprise that Disney is concerned about physical security, given that tens of millions of people visit its parks every year. And the film and entertainment arm of the company can’t be complacent; witness the fallout from fellow media company Sony Pictures Entertainment’s SNE, +2.28% hack last year. Disney may need that extra set of intern hands to up its cyber game.

Disney did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
