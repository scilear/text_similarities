The market is showing a decidedly bullish streak.

The S&P 500 on Monday rose for a fifth session in a row, its longest winning streak this year, as a string of economic data appeared to push back the timing of a Federal Reserve rate hike to 2016.

“I would classify today—and the reversal last Friday—as a change in the perception of the location of risk,” said Ian Winer, director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.

“The market decided Friday morning at 10:30 a.m. that pushing a rate rise out and keeping the easy money policies of this central bank was the most important cue on how to invest than the fundamentals of the economy,” he said.

The S&P 500 SPX, +1.66% rose 35.69 points, or 1.8%, to 1,987.05, with all 10 sectors higher after health-care sector rebounded.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.87% added 304.06 points, or 1.9%, to 16,776.43, with only Nike Inc. NKE, -0.05% in the red.

The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.65% advanced 73.49 points, or 1.6%, at 4,781.26, while the Russell 2000 RUT, +0.84% gained 27.52 points or 2.5%, to 1,141.64.

The rally comes on the heels of one of the biggest reversals for stocks in four years, when the market swooning from a weak jobs report turned sharply positive toward the end of Friday’s close of trading.

The weaker-than-projected jobs report fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve may be more circumspect about tightening monetary policy.

“It is a case where bad [news] is good,” said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management. “Friday’s jobs data was bad and the odds are rising that any change in monetary policy will not occur until 2016 with consensus now expecting March.”

Indeed, the Fed-funds futures market on Monday was pricing in a 7% probability of a rate increase in October, down from 14% Thursday before the weak jobs report, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

Stocks had trimmed some of their gains earlier in the session after the Institute for Supply Management’s nonmanufacturing index, a measure of the services side of the economy, came in lower than expected at its lowest readings since June. But stocks bounced back quickly.

John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, was cautiously optimistic about the market in the near term, and projected more upside potential as people return to the market.

Engelke was a bit more specific. “There is a 65% chance that the market has turned the proverbial corner,” he said.
