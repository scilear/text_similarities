Led by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, half of the top 10 on this year's Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans were founders or heads of technology companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).

But six of the top 10 billionaires on the latest Forbes list were less rich this year than a year ago, as a lethargic market trimmed the value of their massive stock holdings. Still, the net worth of the 400 richest Americans climbed by $50 billion to a collective $2.34 trillion.

Bill Gates, whose wealth is valued at $76 billion, heads the list for the 22nd time in a row, followed by his friend Warren Buffett, the sage of Omaha and head of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKB), with $62 billion. Both are worth about $5 billion less now than this time a year ago.

Microsoft shares, which are down 6% so far this year, closed up 1.9% on the stock market today. Berkshire Hathaway shares have lost 14% this year but finished up 1.2% Wednesday.

Larry Ellison, founder and head of business software giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), was No. 3 with $47.5 billion.

Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos was No. 4 with $47 billion. He was among the top 10's biggest wealth gainers from a year ago, adding $16.5 billion. The recent performance of Amazon shares, which have jumped 63% so far this year, helped put Bezos in the top 10.

Charles Koch and his brother David Koch were No. 5 and No. 6, respectively, with both having about $41 billion. Together they head privately held diversified chemicals, energy and manufacturing giant Koch Industries.

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was No. 7 with $40.3 billion. He also grew his wealth, adding $6.3 billion vs. last year. Facebook shares have climbed 22% from a Jan. 15 low.

Publishing magnate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was No. 8 with $38.6 billion. Jim Walton, son of Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) founder Sam Walton, holds the No. 9 spot with $33.7 billion. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) co-founder and CEO Larry Page was No. 10 with $33.3 billion.

Forbes said the entry level this year was tougher, with a record minimum $1.7 billion required to make the list, $150 million higher than a year ago. As a result, 145 U.S. billionaires didn't make the cut, although there were 25 newcomers due to hot tech stocks, M&A activity and rising property values.
