At first glance, Microsoft's new Surface Pro 4 doesn't look that much different than last year's Surface Pro 3. But there are a slew of upgrades on the Surface Pro 4, as well as its accessories, that should make for an even better computing experience. Its screen is slightly bigger, the Type Cover feels a lot more like a traditional laptop keyboard and using the Surface Pen now feels like actually putting pen to paper. At Microsoft's huge device launch event in New York City earlier this week, we talked with Dave Mitchell, the senior director of program management for the Microsoft Devices Group, who gave us the lowdown on how his team went about improving on the already great Surface Pro 3. Check out the interview below, and be sure to take a look at our hands-on with the Surface Pro 4.
