NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Both super-modern, lightweight, ultra-portable, touchscreen tablets that can also be used as laptops when you buy an easy-to-attach keyboard. But Alphabet's (GOOG - Get Report) (GOOGL - Get Report) Google Pixel C and Microsoft's (MSFT - Get Report) Surface Pro 4 accomplish tasks in somewhat different ways.

Which device fits your needs best?





The Pixel C is an Android tablet and one of the first devices to ship with the latest version of Android, codenamed Marshmallow. That makes the Pixel C more tablet than notebook in its design. To date, actual Chromebook Pixel notebooks run on software called Chrome OS - basically an operating system built solely around a Web browser and not much else.

The Pixel C offers a super-bright, high-definition, 10.2-inch touchscreen, a Nvidia (NVDA - Get Report) Tegra X1 octa-core processor, Maxwell GPU, 3 GB of RAM and either 32 or 64 GB of storage. Pixel C also sports a reversible, USB Type-C port for powering the tablet, charging the battery and all other connections. Cameras measure 8 and 2 MP, back and front

Microsoft's fourth-generation tablet computer, the Surface Pro 4, ships with the latest, 64-bit version of the new Windows 10 Pro OS. The new 12.3-inch touchscreen is slightly larger than the 12.0-inch display in the previous Surface Pro 3.

Inside the Pro 4's magnesium casing is your choice of a sixth-generation Intel (INTC - Get Report) m3, i5 or i7 processor, an Intel HD or Iris graphics chip, 4, 8 or 16 GB of RAM and 128, 256, 512 GB up to 1 TB of storage. There's a wide selection of ports including a full-sized USB 3.0, miniDisplay, headset jack (analog only), and a microSD card expansion slot. Rear and front cameras measure 8 and 5 MP, respectively.
