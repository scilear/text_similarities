NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- General Electric (GE - Get Report) announced earlier today that it has reached two separate agreements to sell its railcar operations.

Marmon Holdings will receive GE's tank car fleet assets and railcar repair facilities, and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) will get the remaining railcar leasing business.

Terms of the transactions are not being disclosed, GE said.

"These transactions are another example of the value generated by GE Capital's strong businesses and exceptional teams as we continue to demonstrate speed and execute on our strategy to sell most of the assets of GE Capital," GE Capital CEO Keith Sherin said in a statement.

This action comes as the Fairfield, CT-based conglomerate is looking to focus more on its industrial business and shed its financial services arm, the Wall Street Journal reports.

GE shares are declining 0.32% to $25.14 in Thursday's early morning trading session.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates GENERAL ELECTRIC CO as a Hold with a ratings score of C+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (GE) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed, some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, good cash flow from operations and expanding profit margins. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including feeble growth in the company's earnings per share, deteriorating net income and generally higher debt management risk.
