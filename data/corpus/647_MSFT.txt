euNetworks delivers cloud connectivity with its Cloud Connect solution, offering connectivity through a private network in preference to using the Internet. Azure ExpressRoute connections in place with this new relationship do not go over the public Internet and offer more reliability (improved SLA), a lower committed latency and higher security as a result. Connection speeds range from 10Mbps to 10Gbps, with granular access methods suited for large enterprises to small branch offices. As a specialist in high bandwidth low latency connectivity solutions, euNetworks offers both scalable and predictable connectivity to the cloud.

“We are a bandwidth infrastructure company, owning and operating our own fibre networks that connect more than 260 data centres and 1,000 buildings across Europe as well as offering direct access to cloud platforms,” said Kevin Dean, Chief Marketing Officer of euNetworks. “Our relationship with Microsoft Azure means we offer unmatched direct access to this platform across our pan European footprint, offering significant benefit to companies as they move more of their IT infrastructure into the cloud.”

“We are delighted to welcome euNetworks to the Azure ExpressRoute ecosystem,” said Ross Ortega, Principal Product Manager, Networking, Microsoft Azure. “Their technical expertise and network footprint across Europe is a great addition to our growing partner network as demand for access to Azure continues to grow.”
