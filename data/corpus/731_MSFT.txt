Yahoo Inc. has just launched an email graveyard.

In an attempt to compete with Google Inc.’s Gmail GOOGL, +1.39% GOOGL, +1.39% GOOG, +1.43% Yahoo YHOO, +1.77% rolled out an update to its mail services on Thursday that will aggregate emails from a user’s Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo and Outlook accounts on both mobile and desktop, allowing them to access them all through the Yahoo interface.

The announcement comes as Gmail continues to pull away from its competitors. Yahoo Mail’s monthly unique visitors on desktop and mobile fell 7% year-over-year in August to 70.1 million, while Google’s share increased 12% to 135.2 million visitors, according to data provided by comScore.

Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT, +1.76% email properties — Hotmail and Outlook — and AOL, which is being acquired by Verizon Communications VZ, +2.30% haven't fared much better. Visitors to Microsoft’s email services fell 10% year-over-year in August to 32.5 million, while AOL Email saw unique visitors dive by 30% to 14 million.

Yahoo said it is rolling out the new service to meet the demands of users who have more than one email account but don’t want to manage multiple passwords, websites or apps.

“Mobile use requires a faster and smarter inbox,” said Jeff Bonforte, senior vice president of communication products at Yahoo. “Both of these needs are at the center of our new app.”

The company also took a dig at Google’s two-step verification by launching a one-touch key with the Yahoo Mail app, also updated Thursday, that will replace traditional passwords, calling two-step verification processes such as the one used by Google “inconvenient and confusing.”

Shares of Yahoo climbed 3% to $33.04 in recent trade, though they are down 14% over the last three months. Shares of Google gained 1.2% to $688.82 in recent trade, pushing them up 18% over the last three months. Both stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in recent months, which is down 5%.
