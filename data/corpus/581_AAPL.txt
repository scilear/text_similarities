NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Apple (AAPL - Get Report) are up 1.6% to $115.26 in trading on Monday after the company made the latest update for its Apple Watch software available to download this afternoon.

The Cupertino, CA-based tech company just released the final version of watchOS 2 as an over-the-air update, according to Tech Crunch.

An unexpected bug in the system caused the company to push back its scheduled September 16 launch of the update.

Apple Watch debuted five months ago with research firm IDC reporting that the company shipped 3.6 million units during the second quarter, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Those figures suggest that sales of the wearable device are outpacing the sales of the launch of the company's iPad five years ago.

Apple has not commented on the IDC figure or provided its own sales figures for the Apple Watch, but CEO Tim Cook has said that sales of the watch have surpassed the company's own expectations.

TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results. "
