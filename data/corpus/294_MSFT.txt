First Apple, then Google, now Microsoft. Over the past month, we've seen some of the biggest tech companies either hold keynotes or just straight-up announce a ton of stuff. Now, rounding out the list, Microsoft is about to put on a big press event of its own, where it's promising several new devices running Windows 10. We'd say a refreshed Surface Pro is a safe bet, given that it hasn't received an update in a year and a half. This would also be a good time for Microsoft to officially launch Windows 10 Mobile and indeed, we've seen leaks for a number of handsets, including the 5.2-inch Lumia 950, the 5.7-inch 950 XL and the lower-end Lumia 550. We also want to know when we can buy HoloLens, but we're less confident that Satya Nadella & co. will address that this week. In any case, all will be revealed tomorrow -- bookmark our liveblog link and check back at 10AM Eastern for full coverage.
