ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Federal regulators say they have no problem with General Electric dismantling a Hudson River PCB cleanup plant as dredging wraps up, despite government advisers asking to keep it in place while they assess results of the $2 billion cleanup.

The Environmental Protection Agency says the company could use a new, temporary facility if additional dredging is required. It also says it doesn't see any agreement in sight for GE to do more.

The Hudson River Natural Resource Trustees had asked the EPA to delay dismantling the 100-acre plant as they assess progress cleaning up decades of PCB pollution from GE's capacitor plants in Hudson Falls and Fort Edward.

But GE says Thursday that it is successfully completing the cleanup ordered by the EPA and no further dredging has been required.
