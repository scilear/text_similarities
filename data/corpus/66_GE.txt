S&P warned that Trian Fund Management, run by activist investor Nelson Peltz, is urging General Electric (NYSE:GE) to buy back shares "beyond our current expectations," representing a potential threat to its financial health.

In a Wednesday report, the ratings agency revised its outlook on GE's credit rating to "negative" from "stable," which means that a downgrade is possible within the next two years. The agency affirmed GE's AA+ corporate credit rating, however.

"The negative outlook reflects our expectation that the company could potentially adopt a less conservative financial policy than we currently expect," S&P said.

GE shares closed up 0.9% to 28.03 in the stock market today and has traded above its 200-day moving average since Monday.

On Monday, Trian announced that it had bought a $2.5 billion stake in GE â€” roughly 1% of the Fairfield, Conn.-based company. It has said that it wants GE to explore more share buybacks, including by taking on new debt.

General Electric has focused on bulking up its industrial operations and selling off other units, such as parts of its financial businesses.

Peltz, whose fund in the past made aggressive moves at PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) and Kraft Foods, called GE "undervalued and underappreciated by the market." Trian isn't seeking seats on GE's board.
