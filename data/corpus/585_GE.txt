OK Related Issuers Mubadala GE Capital Ltd Related Research Credit Opinion: Mubadala GE Capital Ltd Rating Action: Moody's affirms Mubadala GE Capital's Baa2 ratings; outlook changed to negative Rating Action: Moody's assigns (P)Baa2 ratings to Mubadala GE Capital's new Global MTN programme Rating Action: Moody's assigns Baa2 issuer ratings to Mubadala GE Capital Ltd; outlook stable Rating Action: Moody's affirms Mubadala GE Capital Ltd's Baa2 ratings; outlook negative Global Credit Research - 12 Oct 2015 Limassol, October 12, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service has today affirmed the Baa2 long-term issuer and debt ratings of Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala GE capital Ltd (MGEC), a joint venture (JV) between Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala; Aa2, Stable/Prime-1) and General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC; A1, stable). This affirmation incorporates Moody's view on MGEC's recent announcement that it will sell substantially all its assets and those of its subsidiaries to MidCap Finco Ltd (MidCap). The outlook remains negative. The affirmation reflects our view that the $3.6 billion of assets that will be sold by MGEC to MidCap, payable in cash, will be sufficient to repay all of MGEC's outstanding debt and other liabilities before the company winds down all its activities. The negative outlook reflects the potential execution risks that will remain until the sale is completed. RATINGS RATIONALE This rating action follows the decision earlier this year of General Electric Company's (GE; A1, stable) to downsize GECC, which originates and services most of MGEC's asset base, and the recent announcement regarding the sale of MGEC's assets to MidCap. The affirmation is primarily driven by Moody's expectation that the sale of $3.6 billion of assets, payable in cash, will be sufficient to manage the subsequent full repayment of all liabilities (estimated at less than $3 billion as of Q3 2015) and will be completed by year-end. We expect the standalone financial profile of the company, reflected in baseline credit assessment of ba3, to remain solid until the sale completion and the repayment of all liabilities. MGEC's asset performance remained strong this year with a stable ratio of problem loans at 1.5% as of June 2015, proving risk management framework continues to support asset quality. MGEC also continues to benefit from high capital buffers, with a risk-weighted capital ratio of 20% as of June 2015, and robust liquidity ($1.7 billion of available liquidity, which covers in excess of 100% of the entity's debt contractually maturing in the following two years). We expect both shareholders to remain supportive until the complete wind-down of MGEC's activities and to manage the sale execution and liability repayment in an orderly manner. Both Mubadala and GECC have provided capital and liquidity to the joint venture since founding MGEC (55% of MGEC's current borrowings are due to its shareholders as of June 2015) and are committed to the transaction with MidCap. The negative outlook reflects the potential execution risks that will remain until the sale is completed. We expect to withdraw all MGEC's ratings once the sale of assets and repayment of debt is completed. WHAT COULD CHANGE THE RATING UP/DOWN Given current negative outlook and ongoing sale and exit process, upwards rating pressure is limited. Downwards pressure on the ratings could materialize in the event of an unfavourable combination of (1) failure of the sale transaction to MidCap and/or (2) a revision of our assessment of support from MGEC's shareholders. The principal methodology used in these ratings was Finance Company Global Rating Methodology published in March 2012. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology. The Local Market analyst for this rating is Olivier Panis, 971.4.237.9533.
