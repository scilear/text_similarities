FRANKFURT—Volkswagen AG’s chief financial officer remains on course to become chairman of the car maker’s supervisory board, company officials said Thursday, as the car maker pushes forward with an investigation into the emissions scandal that has rocked the company.

Hans Dieter Pötsch, who has been on Volkswagen’s VOW, +3.29% VLKAY, +0.47% executive board since 2003, is set to become chairman of the supervisory board after his candidacy was confirmed at a meeting at Volkswagen late Wednesday, where a committee of key officials discussed the initial findings of the investigation into emissions-rigging at Europe’s biggest car maker.

The committee also said investigations into the roots of the crisis will take several months, and an extraordinary general meeting scheduled for Nov. 9 will be canceled.

Mr. Pötsch’s posting, which would have been decided at the Nov. 9 meeting, will instead be concluded by a court. Frank Witter, now chairman of the Volkswagen Financial Services AG unit, has been nominated to replace Mr. Pötsch as CFO, the committee said.

Volkswagen said earlier this week it had drawn up a plan to refit vehicles affected by the software that apparently allows them to dodge emissions standards. Further details on refitting will be released next week, the committee said.
