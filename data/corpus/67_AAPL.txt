Technology Sector Updates from Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft

(Continued from Prior Part)

In the previous part of this series, we discussed the motivation for Amazon (AMZN) for barring the sale of Apple (AAPL) TV and Google (GOOG) Chromecast on its platform. However, through this action, Amazonâ€™s retail business could be affected, since Google Chromecast and Apple TV are two of the largest players in the streaming device market.

According to a report from Parks Associates, Roku is the leading player in the US streaming device market, with a share of 37% as of 2014. The chart below shows that Google Chromecast ranked second in this market, with a share of 19%. Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV devices are the third and fourth largest players in this market, respectively.

Google and Apple have become even more aggressive players in the streaming devices market of late. Google recently launched two new Chromecast devices, one for the TV, and another for the speakers. Within just two years of launching Chromecast, the company sold more than 20 million Chromecast devices.

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Google has made some enhancements to the Chromecast app. The app now suggests shows to the user. Also, through Chromecast for Audio device, users can stream music from popular music streaming platforms such as Pandora (P) and Spotify.

Apple also launched a revamped version of Apple TV during its September 9 event. Some of the new features included were a new remote, a new tvOS, and renewed focus on games. We discussed this in the series titled Biting into Apple: The New Apple TV .

You can get diversified exposure to Amazon by investing in the Consumer Discretionary SPDR ETF (XLY), holding 8.7% of the stock.
