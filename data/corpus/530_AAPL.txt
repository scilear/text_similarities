Apple introduced the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus yesterday (Sept. 9)—among myriad other things—immediately making the iPhone 6 obsolete. Much like new cars, cellphones lose a large chunk of their value the second you leave the store. But if you’re planning on selling an iPhone 6 to free up some cash for the latest version, here’s some good news: The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have held their value better than the 5S did a year ago, according to data provided by Gazelle, the tech reselling site.

Gazelle told Quartz that the price it offered for an iPhone 6 a year after its launch is up from the price offered for the iPhone 5S a year later, even though both cost the same when they were released. However, the iPhone 5S was the most traded-in item on the site last week, accounting for over a third of all iPhone trade-ins, Gazelle said.
