A few days ago, Microsoft revealed that Windows 10 users could soon help it shape its Xbox app for the new OS. And well, that's happening today. The Xbox Beta app is based on the popular Xbox One Preview Program, which gives people access to features before they're released to the public and lets them provide feedback based on their experience with those. Similarly, Microsoft says the goal with this new application is to have fans provide early input on features and enhancements that are intended to come to the Xbox app for Windows 10. If you're interested in checking it out and being a part of the program, you can download Xbox Beta now from the Windows Store.
