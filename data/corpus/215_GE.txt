TG Therapeutics (TGTX - Get Report) : In an exclusive interview, Cramer sat down with Michael Weiss, chairman, president and CEO of TG Therapeutics, a stock that's down 36% from its highs in March along with the rest of drug sector.

Weiss said his company hopes to have results from the latest clinical trials for its blood cancer treatments within the next six to 12 months. He said the goal is to prolong the lives of patients suffering from these chronic conditions as the company works towards a cure.

On the current debate regarding drug pricing, he said politicians tend to lump all drugs together. In reality, there are innovative drugs that patients are willing to pay anything for, and then there are generics that everyone expects to be affordable.



He said drug companies have a social contract with patients where biotechs expect to be able to recoup their costs for innovation but then make drugs affordable when they go generic. Any change to that model could be a death spiral for the industry, he concluded.
