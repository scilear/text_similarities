NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- There's more to General Electric's (GE - Get Report) plans to increase hiring overseas than making a political statement.

While the iconic manufacturer labeled its decision this month to ship about 500 jobs abroad as a response to the demise of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, it separately plans to add twice that number in France alone.

CEO Jeffrey Immelt reiterated his commitment to create 1,000 positions in Europe's second-biggest economy in under three years during a Wednesday meeting with French President Francois Hollande, according to a statement from Elysee Palace. The jobs were a condition of France's support for GE's $14 billion purchase of Alstom's power business.

Hollande said GE's moves "illustrate the attractiveness of France" and of his government's efforts to facilitate exports from Europe's second-biggest economy. GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., won tentative clearance for the deal from European and U.S. regulators earlier this month.

The purchase is a piece of Immelt's strategy to expand in manufacturing -- generating 90% of profits from sales of jet engines, health-care equipment and locomotives by 2018 -- while exiting most of its lucrative lending operations.

While the CEO has been a vocal advocate of the Ex-Im bank, which provides financing to his manufacturing customers outside the U.S., the overseas hiring probably has more to do with Immelt's core strategy than with the Ex-Im bank's lapsed charter, Ivan Feinseth, an analyst with Tigress Financial Partners, said in an interview.
