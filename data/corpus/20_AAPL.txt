Tech Sector Updates from Apple and Google

Apple (AAPL) is continuing to extend the reach of its Apple Pay service. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal citing Apple’s tech conference, some Starbucks (SBUX) stores will start accepting Apple Pay service by the end of this year, with the complete rollout of Apple Pay at 7,500 Starbucks stores happening by the end of next year. This is great news for Apple, which is making efforts to popularize its mobile payment service.

Apple has announced that more than 1 million US retail locations, including those of major retailers, have already started accepting Apple Pay. Earlier this year, Apple announced that Best Buy (BBY) would start supporting Apple Pay service . During this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference (or WWDC) in June, Apple also announced that Apple Pay service will be accepted at retail stores such as JCPenney (JCP) and Kohl’s (KSS).

Apple also seems to be getting aggressive about expanding its Apple Pay service in international markets. A few months ago, Apple was reportedly in negotiations with top Canadian banks to implement the Apple Pay service in Canada. More recently, according to Reuters, Apple was said to be in talks with Alibaba (BABA) and Chinese banks about implementing the Apple Pay service in China (FXI).

Apple is looking to leverage the mobile payment market’s potential for rapid growth.
