Note to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors: Keep calm and carry on. That was the theme of a research note Thursday by Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White. White, formerly with Cantor Fitzgerald, initiated coverage of Apple at his new firm with a buy rating and a 12-month price target of 200.

Apple stock fell 0.7% to 109.58 on the stock market today. It had been as high as 132.97 on July 20 and hit a record high of 134.54 on April 28.

"The sharp correction in Apple's stock this summer represents an attractive entry point as we believe fears surrounding China are overblown, concerns around difficult iPhone comparisons are short-sighted, and the appreciation for the implications of this transformational super cycle is surprisingly muted," White said.

White predicted continued strong smartphone sales with the new iPhone 6S handsets and said that the Apple Watch will be a "major hit this holiday season."

He also sees big opportunities for expansion in China and India.

White called Apple "one of the most undervalued technology stocks in the world."
