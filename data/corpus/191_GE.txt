NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- General Electric Co. (GE - Get Report) shares are up 0.41% to $24.65 in afternoon trading on Thursday as the company looks to sell its asset management business.

The company said that it will look to sell the unit as a part of its recent move to trim its financial service business.

"GE Asset Management has world-class investment capabilities and an experienced, talented team that has done a terrific job managing assets for benefit plans serving GE employees and retirees, as well as other investors," said CEO Jeff Immelt.

"Over time, there has been significant interest from premier investment firms in acquiring GEAM, reflecting its reputation and attractiveness to others in the asset management industry. As we continue to transform GE to focus on our industrial core, now is the right time to explore such a sale," Immelt concluded.

TheStreet Ratings team rates GENERAL ELECTRIC CO as a Hold with a ratings score of C+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (GE) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed â€“ some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, good cash flow from operations and expanding profit margins. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including a generally disappointing performance in the stock itself, feeble growth in the company's earnings per share and deteriorating net income."
