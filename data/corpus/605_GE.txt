NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- General Electric (GE - Get Report) plans to report third-quarter earnings before the start of the trading day on Oct 16, and here's what savvy investors will be looking at.

Of course, earnings and revenue numbers will be important -- and we'll discuss those later -- but one of the most important parts of Friday's quarterly release will be details on the outcome of General Electric's dramatic sale of sizeable chunks of its financial services and appliances business, as part of its bid to return to its roots as an industrial products company.

The sales include a deal to sell GE Capital's commercial lending and leasing business to. It's an unprecedented transaction for GE, which will hand over about $32 billion worth of assets and 3,000 employees to Wells Fargo and significantly reduce the company's focus on financial services.

As part of the GE's $200 billion asset sale program, GE Capital has already signed a staggering $126 billion worth of deals, blowing its revised target of $100 billion out of the water. Expect the same trend to follow next year for GE's international operations.

GE plans to retain only financial units that have a direct bearing on core industrial operations of the newly restructured, leaner and nimbler GE. These will include GE Capital Aviation Services, Healthcare Equipment Finance, and Energy Financial Services.
