SEATTLE -- Chinese President Xi Jinping’s first state visit to the U.S. set off a tug of war here Wednesday between optimism about commercial relations between the U.S. and China and fear that China isn’t doing enough to open its doors to foreign companies or combat cybercrime.

In front of some of the top executives of both countries -- including Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +1.53% Tim Cook, Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN, +1.46% Jeff Bezos and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s 0700, +1.91% Pony Ma -- Xi and other Chinese officials continued their push to highlight the scope of business opportunities in China.

The country of 1.3 billion people is now the world’s largest market in booming areas such as smartphones and online shopping.

Xi also pledged to address U.S. concerns that China isn’t moving fast enough to ease restrictions on foreign investment, while playing down tensions in other areas ahead of his summit with President Barack Obama on Friday. “China will open up still wider to the outside world. Without reform there will be no driving force,” Xi said.

American business executives and Obama administration officials expressed doubts about Xi’s commitment.

“If those reforms do move forward then the opportunity for collective growth is high, but there is a big if,” Dean Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group, said Wednesday at a U.S.-China Internet forum hosted by Microsoft Corp MSFT, +1.76% .
