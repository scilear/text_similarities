Startup invention company Quirky Inc., which specializes in developing products to control household appliances with smartphones and other devices, has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy to launch a sale.

The company filed for bankruptcy with a plan to sell its Wink business — which holds its 60 household product and applications and has partnerships with General Electric Co. GE, +2.53% Honeywell International Inc. HON, +3.86% and others — to an affiliate of Flextronics International Ltd. FLEX, -1.31% for $15 million, an offer that will be tested at auction.

Quirky is also searching for a buyer for the rest of its assets, saying it hopes to preserve its online invention community but will discontinue all of its business lines that can’t be sold at auction.

Quirky raised about $170 million in venture capital, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Its investors included Norwest Venture Partners, RRE Ventures, GE Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, in order of the size of their stake, according to a bankruptcy filing.

Quirky was founded as an invention platform in 2009 by Ben Kaufman. Kaufman was replaced as CEO last month after Quirky laid off 159 employees and as it became clear that the company’s efforts to sell its Wink business could only be executed in bankruptcy. As of Tuesday, Quirky employed 90 people.
