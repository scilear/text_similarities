NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) shares are continuing to rise by 0.3% to $115.70 on Tuesday morning, as the tech giant is seeing strong pre-orders on its new iPhones--both the 6s and the 6s Plus, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Apple first unveiled the new iPhones at an event in San Francisco last week, buyers were able to pre-order them starting this past Saturday.

So far, Apple said it is seeing an extremely positive customer response.

"We are on pace to beat last year's 10 million unit first-weekend record when the new iPhones go on sale September 25," the company told CNBC.com.

One major factor helping sales is the phone's availability in China as this year pre-orders were available earlier, while last year, pre-orders in China were not available until late October, Barron's reports.

"We believe three more weeks would add an additional 4.2 million to 4.5 million units for iPhone 6S sales in 4Q15," analysts at Rosenblatt Securities stated.

The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook."
