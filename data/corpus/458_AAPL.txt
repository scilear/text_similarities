Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors should reset their expectations for iPhone 6S sales, which are currently too high, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a research note Wednesday.

"Near-term expectations for iPhone sales remain unrealistically high," Hargreaves said. "Anecdotal evidence suggests demand for iPhone 6S is lower than demand for iPhone 6."

Apple's statement Monday that first-weekend iPhone 6S sales are on pace to beat last year's record first-weekend iPhone 6 sales likely is more about supply than demand, he said.

"The preponderance of data points suggests that demand for the iPhone 6S is lower than it was for the iPhone 6, possibly meaningfully so," Hargreaves said. "This includes Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search data, device shipment times, third-party surveys, a lack of comments from carriers, and a lack of quantitative comment on pre-orders in Apple's statement."

Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program is not likely to drive a meaningful increase in iPhone 6S sales, he said. But other analysts disagree on that point.

S&P Capital IQ Angelo Zino on Wednesday raised his rating on Apple stock to strong buy from hold with a price target of 150. He said Apple's entry into the mobile phone financing business with its iPhone Upgrade Program is a "notable positive" for the company.

UBS analyst Steven Milunovich on Tuesday said the iPhone Upgrade Program "could be a big deal." He reiterated his buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 150.

Apple stock closed down 2.1% at 113.92 in the stock market today.
