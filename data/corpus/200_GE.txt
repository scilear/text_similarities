NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- General Electric's (GE - Get Report) massive share swap with former lending unit Synchrony may return $3 billion less to investors than the company expected two months ago.

The reason? Synchrony's (SYF - Get Report) shares have fallen 10% since GE reported earnings in July, when CEO Jeffrey Immelt estimated the Fairfield, Conn.-based company's stake in its former subsidiary was worth about $24 billion. The Bank of Montreal downgraded its rating on stock in the private-label credit card issuer on Wednesday to "market perform," the equivalent of "hold," and cut its price target to $35 from $40.

GE still owns 85% of Stamford, Conn.-based Synchrony, which it plans to offer to GE investors in a tax-free exchange for GE stock at the end of the year. The returned GE shares would then be retired, increasing the value of the remaining stock on the open market and boosting dividends, because the amount set aside for payments would be spread over a smaller pool.

The Synchrony swap is a piece of Immelt's overall strategy to refocus GE on its industrial roots while exiting most of the finance business. The GE Capital lending arm once generated more than 40% of the parent company's revenue but also heightened risk significantly during the 2008 financial crisis and subjected GE to greater regulatory scrutiny afterward.

The more Synchrony shares decline relative to GE's, the less shares the former parent will be able to take back, said Nick Heymann, an analyst with William Blair, who estimated the decline in Synchrony shares would reduce the exchange value by about $3 billion.

"What you want to see is the spread between the absolute values of GE and Synchrony as wide as possible, but that positive gap has started to narrow," Heymann said.
