LONDON-- Apple Inc. returned to the eurozone bond market on Thursday, joining a long list of U.S. companies that have raised funds this year by issuing debt in euros.

The largest publicly traded U.S. company by market capitalization is looking to issue two bonds in euros, according to a deal announcement seen by The Wall Street Journal. Apple AAPL, +1.53% didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

U.S. companies have flocked to Europe’s bond markets this year, attracted by low borrowing rates in the euro area as a result of the European Central Bank’s easy-money policies. As of Sept. 7, U.S. nonfinancial companies had raised EUR53.9 billion, according to Dealogic, a record amount of euro issuance for U.S. firms.

Apple’s move comes as the company is again the news with the latest iterations of its popular iPhone and iPad tablet as well as a revamped Apple TV, a home-entertainment device.

Apple will use the proceeds of the bond issues to fund share buybacks and dividend payouts among other things, according to the announcement.
