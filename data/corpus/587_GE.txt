NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- General Electric (GE - Get Report) is poised for a modest move higher, technical analysis shows, and now could be the time to use stock options to profit from such a move.

General Electric plans to report earnings next Thursday, before the open, but unlike many other companies, General Electric typically doesn't have much in the way of earnings surprises or big stock price moves in the wake of its earnings reports.

The history of General Electric's earnings is that outcomes closely match predictions. In three of the last four quarters, General Electric beat analysts' estimates by a penny, and in one, it matched estimates exactly.

Still, the current chart of General Electric has some bullish signals worth noting.

This chart reveals the narrow trading range typical for General Electric, but starting in September, the trading range has been more volatile. Bollinger Bands provide a bullish symptom. The stock closed all four sessions so far this week above the upper bands. This indicates price strength.

Supporting this strength, a bullish engulfing pattern formed, followed by an upside gap above resistance and additional upward days moving to a new high for the past six months. This gapping move was confirmed as bullish by a moderate volume spike.
