Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKB) founder Warren Buffett, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and Jack Ma of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) were among top business leaders who attended a roundtable with China's President Xi Jinping during his visit to America.

The Paulson Institute hosted the meeting Wednesday. Also in attendance were top representatives from Chinese companies like Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) as well as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, Buffett from Berkshire Hathaway, Cook, Bob Iger from Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz.

On Tuesday, Xi said China would "never close its open door to the world." He added that Beijing is "a strong defender of cybersecurity" and wants to start a dialogue with the U.S. about fighting cyberattacks, as China is a victim of hacks too.

Chinese hackers are accused of targeting personal emails of top national security and corporate officials. In 2007, Chinese hackers repeatedly infiltrated the networks of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and other F-35 contractors to steal design aspects to create their own stealth jet.

Lockheed shares dipped 0.4% to close at 202.77.

America could still impose sanctions on China over the alleged attacks, and President Obama will stop staying at the Waldorf Astoria during trips to New York due to surveillance issues after a Chinese insurance company bought the luxury hotel.
