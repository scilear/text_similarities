Just in time for new 4K and 5K iMacs, Apple released a major update of iMovie for OS X that adds 4K video editing, along with a slew of other changes. The iOS version of iMovie got 4K support last month to coincide with the debut of the iPhone 6s. Now that both versions of the movie editing suite support higher res video, you'll also be able to continue edits on your Mac that you've started with your iPhone or iPad. The updates won't bring professionals to iMovie anytime soon, but it could encourage regular consumers to explore the wonders of editing (so your family isn't stuck viewing your 30-minute home movie clips). Additionally, the new iMovie also supports 1080p at 60 frames per second for smoother footage, which is ideal for shooting sports and other action-heavy clips.
