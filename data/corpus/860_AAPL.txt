If you haven't ordered your new iPhone yet, be prepared to wait a few weeks.

Although the new iPhones officially debut on Sept. 25, all models are already sold out on Apple's website, which blog 9to5Mac first noticed.

The new iPhones will still be available in Apple stores and carrier stores starting at 8 a.m. on Sept. 25, but preorders are already on back order.

All versions of the iPhone 6S, which include all color combinations and storage options regardless of carrier, are pushed back by one to two weeks.

The larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6S Plus is on hold for three to four weeks.

This isn't unusual â€” Apple's new iPhones usually sell out fast. It's rare to receive your iPhone on launch day unless you place your order as soon as Apple's preorder page goes live.

Last year, the iPhone 6 Plus was particularly hard to find. Business Insider's Nicholas Carlson couldn't find an iPhone 6 Plus after visiting three AT&T stores weeks after the phone officially launched.

Apple sold 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus units in the phones' first weekend of availability last year, and the company told CNBC that it's on pace to beat that record this year.
