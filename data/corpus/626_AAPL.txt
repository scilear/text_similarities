NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The battle over streaming media devices has reached a new, more contentious level.

Amazon (AMZN - Get Report) has decided to ban the sale of Apple (AAPL - Get Report) TVs and Google's (GOOG - Get Report) (GOOGL - Get Report) Chromecast from its marketplace, as Bloomberg first reported yesterday. While perhaps not too surprising -- Amazon is not known for playing nice with competitors -- the move exemplifies just how important streaming and streaming devices have become for Amazon, and how far it's willing to go to promote them.

In an email to sellers, Amazon explained that all Apple TVs and Chromecasts had to be removed from the marketplace by October 29 because they don't work well with Prime Video. "Over the last three years, Prime Video has become an important part of Prime," the e-mail read. "It's important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion."

Amazon will continue selling Rokus, Microsoft's (MSFT - Get Report) Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation, since they support Prime Video streaming.

As it stands, there are workarounds consumers can use to stream Prime Video on the Apple and Google devices, but there is not an actual Prime Video app for the devices themselves.

At first glance, the move could be seen as an effort from Amazon to boost sales of its own streaming devices, the Fire TV and the Fire TV stick. But Amazon.com is certainly not the only place on the Internet that sells streaming devices.

"While this may help generate incremental sales of the Amazon Fire stick, we view the move as negative for consumer selection," said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali.
