NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) shares are declining 0.63% to $111.09 on Wednesday after a jury in Madison, WI found that the tech giant violated a patent held by the University of Wisconsin-Madison's licensing arm, Reuters reports.

As a result, the company could be liable for up to $862 million in damages.

Specifically, the jury found that the chips inside the company's iPhone and iPad infringes the university's patent.

The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) first sued Apple in January 2014, and the Cupertino, CA-based company denied the claims, ZDnet.com noted.

Then, WARF sued again last month, this time focusing on Apple's most recent chips used in the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, along with the iPad Pro, Reuters said.

This isn't the tech giant's first time battling lawsuits targeting its products.
