Samsung Electronics Co.’s new mobile-payment service Samsung Pay wasn’t impacted by a Chinese hacking attack, and no customer information was lost, the company said in a blog.

The attack impacted three servers of LoopPay, a startup that was acquired by Samsung earlier this year and served as the basis for its payment service.

“The reported incident was related to LoopPay’s office network which handles e-mail, file servers and printing within the company,” the blog posted Thursday said. “This network is physically separate from the production network that handles payment transactions and run by Samsung.”

Samsung Pay, which debuted in South Korea in August and became available in the U.S. in September, helps Samsung match a similar offering from Apple Inc., whose Apple Pay mobile-payment service has been out for a year. While Samsung hasn’t released usage numbers, “Samsung Pay is off to an amazing start,” the blog said. Older mobile-payment services, such as Google Wallet and Apple Pay, have struggled to reach mainstream adoption.

After targeting retailers like Target Corp., more recently hackers have been targeting health-care companies and even credit-tracking firm Experian Plc. Because mobile payment services can be connected to consumers’ credit, debit and rewards cards, they represent a wealth of information that could be valuable to hackers.

“Samsung is extremely committed to securing and protecting user data to the highest industry standards,” Darlene Cedres, Samsung’s chief privacy officer, said in the statement.

The attack was first reported by the New York Times.
