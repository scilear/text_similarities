Jim Cramer answered viewers' social media questions on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday and explained why investors should own stock of General Electric (GE). Cramer said 'Jeff Immelt is back,' and GE's industrial business showed strength in its earnings report. Cramer said GE's performance is just going to get better. Another viewer asked about Seagate Technology (STX), and Cramer said to take a chance on the stock. Cramer said he knew everyone was going to hate the stock Friday morning, but Seagate is now yielding almost 6% and the company has 'giant cash flows.' Cramer was asked if Facebook (FB) would break through $100 a share. He pointed out that both he and Jack Mohr, the research director for the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio that Cramer manages, think the stock has run up too high. Cramer said Facebook usually sells off after earnings and investors should be mindful of that. But Cramer added that he loves the stock.
