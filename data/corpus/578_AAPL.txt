NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) has confirmed that it acquired Perceptio, an artificial intelligence startup that makes image-identifying technology for smartphones, Bloomberg reports.

Specifically, Perceptio develops "deep learning" technology, which allows your smartphones to recognize images without outside sources, Bloomberg said.

The tech giant has been eyeing artificial intelligence for some time as it looks to enhance virtual assistant services like Siri.

This is its second artificial intelligence acquisition in four days. Last Friday, the Cupertino, CA-based company bought VocallQ, a U.K.-based startup that makes digital personal assisitants, Bloomberg noted.

Apple shares are falling 0.66% to $110.01 on Tuesday.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results.
