Apple will reopen its company store at its headquarters in Cupertino on Saturday at 10 a.m., the company announced on its site.

The store, which has been in its current location since 1993, has been the only place in the world that sells Apple-branded merchandise. It has been a popular destination for tourists and locals.

While the store didn’t sell major Apple products such as iPhones and iPads, it was the place to go for T-shirts, lanyards, cups, water bottles and pens, all with the Apple logo on them. It also sold gear, such as cases and headphones. According to its Yelp reviews, parking was easy.

The company closed the store in June for refurbishment. The newly renovated store will, for the first time, sell the full line of Apple products. It reportedly will also have a whole new collection of merchandise and may have added historical elements. It will not have a Genius Bar, Apple’s technical support help desk.

Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, may have had a hand in the store’s new look, reports 9-to-5 Mac.

We’ll check it out and report back what we find.
