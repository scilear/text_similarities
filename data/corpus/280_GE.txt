Q: Should I buy GE, too?

A: Activist investor Nelson Peltz thinks General Electric should be worth much more. He's buying the stock causing other investors to wonder if there's hidden value.

GE is amid a painful restructuring by selling off its once massive finance business. These steps have caused the company's revenue and net income to stagnate. GE at the same time is trying to regain focus on its core manufacturing businesses and has been made acquisitions to speed up things.

Peltz has long said GE is worth more than the roughly $26 a share the stock has been hovering around the past year. Shares jumped 6% immediately on the news of Peltz' $2.5 billion stake Monday. Wall Street analysts have called GE stock a buy well before Peltz jumped in. GE shares are rated "outperform" on average with Wall Street analysts, says S&P Capital IQ. But it's difficult to get overly enthusiastic until the company can regain its growth. The average 18-months price target is about 11% higher than Monday's close. GE's stock doesn't look cheap using traditional valuation techniques due to its divestitures. The stock trades for a lofty 49.4 times diluted earnings the past 12 months. New Constructs, which compares stocks to their expected cash flow, says the stock is dangerous.
