NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Stocks continue to move higher following Friday's big rally, with another 1.5% gain in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by early afternoon Monday.

On CNBC's "Fast Money Halftime" show, Stephen Weiss, founder and managing partner of Short Hills Capital Partners, noted that Friday's disappointing non-farm payrolls report has led many investors to believe the Federal Reserve will continue to hold off on hiking interest rates -- possibly until next year.

That theory has led stocks to rally over the past few days, indicating that the rate hike is more important than many investors had been implying, Weiss argued. He noted that biotech is down on Monday, while energy is doing well. The market has momentum, but don't rule out a retest of the October 2014 lows, he warned.

Joseph Terranova, chief market strategist for Virtus Investment Partners, disagreed, saying this two-day rally isn't getting enough respect from investors. It vastly reduces the odds that we'll retest the August lows or the October 2014 lows. Earnings expectations are low, so if the results are good, it could add fuel to the fire when it comes to the rally, he said.

"The market looks good from here," Terranova added.

Amid the market rally, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX.X) has fallen to its lowest level in months, noted Pete Najarian, co-founder of optionmonster.com and trademonster.com. Look for the index to close below its 50-day moving average for several sessions in order for the bulls to see continued momentum.

Greg Fleming, president at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, says volatility will likely stay in the market, but overall, the U.S. economy is doing just fine. He expects the economy to positively surprise investors over the next 10 to 20 years. Investors need to keep calm and stick to their plan despite short-term gyrations in the market.
