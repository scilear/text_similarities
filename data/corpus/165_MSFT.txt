Stubbornly high levels of older personal computers still in the sales channel are hindering Windows 10 PC sales, Morgan Stanley says. PC inventory levels have been elevated since early 2015 after manufacturers built too many PCs late last year, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a report Thursday. To prepare for the Windows 10 product cycle, the industry began clearing inventory in the second quarter, resulting in a decline in production and shipments.

"Our data suggests that even at the seasonal lows in July, inventory was well above peak levels during the Windows 8 launch year (late 2012)," Huberty said.

Computer makers such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Dell and Lenovo have hoped that Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows 10, released on July 29, would spur PC replacement sales.

But initial Windows 10 demand isn't helping to digest the inventory glut, Huberty said.

"Our U.S. PC channel tracker reveals two takeaways regarding the Win 10 refresh cycle: (1) channel inventory was much too high coming into the cycle; and (2) early sell-out isn't helping to clear inventory. As a result, we're cautious on PC sell-in heading into the holiday quarter," she said.

On Wednesday, research firm Gartner said that personal computer and tablet owners are holding on to their current devices longer, putting a crimp on sales of new devices.

Gartner predicts that PC shipments will fall 7.3% to 291 million units worldwide this year. It sees no change in PC shipments in 2016 and a 4.1% increase to 303 million units in 2017.
