The Big Apple's very own flagship Microsoft store is opening soon. Today, the Windows maker announced that its massive five-story, 22,269 square foot retail space in the heart of New York City will open October 26th. This new shopping outlet, which has been in development for nearly a year, is located at 677 Fifth Avenue -- a few blocks away from Apple's iconic "Cube" store. In addition to NYC, Microsoft says it'll also be inaugurating another flagship store in Sydney, Australia, but that won't be until November 12th. Of course, if you happen to pay a visit to either, you can expect a grand showcase of all-things-Microsoft, including Windows 10 devices, the Xbox One and whole lot more.
