Volkswagen gave a New York debut Monday to the new Passat midsize sedan at the worst possible time.

VW was stuck having to put on a happy face at a time in which it faces a crisis: the disclosure that it cheated on emissions testing for 482,000 Passats diesels and other cars. Making matters worse: the diesel version of the car that it was unveiling is at the center of its admitted deception.

Yes, the new 2016 Passat is scheduled to come with the same 2-liter diesel engine that landed VW in trouble with regulators and consumers. The company is also now the subject of a criminal probe and lawsuits. Currently, no new diesel Passat can be sold because VW is yet to come up with solution to make the cars comply with clean air laws.

There will also be two gas engines -- a 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine and a 3.6-liter V-6.

The restyled Passat was given a new hood, front fenders, grille, bumpers, trunklid and LED tailights and headlights.
