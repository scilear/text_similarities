General Electric Co. says it will stop manufacturing gas engines in Waukesha, Wisconsin and move that production to a new facility in Canada. It employs 350 people at the U.S. plant.

The company says it is making the move after U.S. lawmakers failed to renew a program that allows foreign companies to borrow money to buy U.S. products.

Foreign companies typically use the U.S. Export-Import Bank to buy expensive U.S. products when bank loans are not available. It stopped new business activities on July 1, so GE says it is looking to foreign versions of the agency to support its customers.

GE said Monday that it plans to build a $265 million state-of-the-art factory in Canada and will have support from the country's export credit agency, Export Development Canada.

The company has recently indicated it plans to move jobs to the United Kingdom, France, Hungary and China in reaction to Congress' failure to support the Ex-Import Bank.

Shares of GE closed down 61 cents, or 2.5 percent, at $24.31 as the broader markets sold off.
