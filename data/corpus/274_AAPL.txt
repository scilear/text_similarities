The second launchpad opportunity is also related to Apple TV: Apple's foray into gaming. I suspect that more established competitors providing a richer gaming experience like PlayStation and Xbox are not Apple's target. Instead, a more expansive reach to the non-fervent gamer is clearly the mission. Companies like Nintendo, which have focused on providing more mainstream gaming experiences, could have the most to fear from Apple's foray into the space. Still, this is clearly a work in progress and it will take significant time for Apple to make progress in becoming an essential gaming hub for the family. This pathway is a start.

Third, Apple clearly recognizes that higher margins come from enterprise business in the long term, particularly as competitors attempt to compete with Apple in the phone and entry-level tablet space. One only needs to see the efforts being made by Amazon with its new tablet reported to be priced near $50 to see that price pressures will ultimately reduce margins. Apple's partnership with IBM and now the introduction of the iPad Pro is obviously positioned as a way to capture higher margins through enterprise sales.
