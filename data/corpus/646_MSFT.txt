WC Fields once said you should "never work with animals or children" - it might be time to add voice-activated assistants to that list.

Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news) chief executive Satya Nadella gave a keynote speech at a sales conference in San Francisco in which he wanted to show off the capabilities of Cortana.

The feature is a direct rival to Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news) 's Siri, and responds to the human voice to carry out tasks and offer up information in an instant.

But the demonstration didn't go to plan.

When he asked Cortana to "show me my most at-risk opportunities", the assistant offered to remind him to buy milk instead.

"No, that's not what I want," he said, as a Bing search bar appeared with the milk request.

He tried a second time, to no avail. "Oh come on," he said.

After a third unsuccessful attempt, a visibly frustrated Mr Nadella apologised to the crowd, saying: "No, this is not going to work.

"Sorry about that. Someone's trying to save me from backstage."

The mobile assistant has recently been incorporated into Windows 10, a feature the Microsoft boss had been keen to show off.
