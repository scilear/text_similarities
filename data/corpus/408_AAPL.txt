Stocks pared their losses heading into the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average — bolstered by 9% and 3% jumps respectively in DuPont (NYSE:DD) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) — held an 0.3% gain. The S&P 500 shed 0.2% while the Nasdaq, down as much as 1.5% earlier, gave up 0.6%. Volume was tracking higher on both exchanges vs. the same time Monday.

Winners slightly outpaced losers on the NYSE, while decliners topped advancers by about a 3-2 margin on the Nasdaq.

Medical stocks were the biggest laggards in the stock market today, with biotechs and drugmakers hurting the most. Energy stocks (fueled by a 4% jump in crude oil prices), gold miners and metal issues led the upside.

Automakers were also lower, dragged down primarily by Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), which skidded 3% in fast trade. Morgan Stanley cut its price target to 450 from 465 and its 2015 Model X delivery forecast by about half to 1,506, citing the higher-than-expected price tag. The stock has been consolidating since mid-July and has recently run into resistance at its 50-day moving average.

Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) reversed lower and fell 3% to a six-week low in heavy volume. Topeka Capital Markets slashed its price target on the Apple chip supplier to 100 from 120. Late Monday, Skyworks said that it's buying PMC-Sierra (NASDAQ:PMCS) for $2 billion in cash. PMC shares soared 33%.

Fellow chip supplier Avago Technologies (NASDAQ:AVGO) gave up 3% in rapid turnover, also to a six-week low. European Union antitrust officials are expected to decide by Nov. 9 if it will approve Avago's $37 billion buyout offer for Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM). Broadcom shares were down 2% in volume.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) avoided the iPhone chip stock sell-off with a near 1% gain in light volume.

Portable oxygen concentrator maker Inogen (NASDAQ:INGN) and Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) were down the most on the IBD 50, with respective losses of 7% and 6%.
