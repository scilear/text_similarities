Stereo headphones from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its subsidiary Beats Electronics drown out the competition when it comes to U.S. teen consumers.

Piper Jaffray's semiannual survey of U.S. teenagers found that Beats by Dr. Dre is the No. 1 brand of headphones. Asked which brand of headphones they planned to buy next, 44.2% of teens said they planned to get Beats, up from 41.9% in the spring and 43.7% in fall 2014. Apple ranked second with 31.7%, up from 31.2% in the spring and 29.8% last fall.

Taken together, Apple's two headphone brands grabbed 75.9% of teen purchase intent in the latest survey.

Coming in a distant third is Skullcandy (NASDAQ:SKUL) with 8.9% of teen purchase intent. The percentage of teens planning to buy Skullcandy headphones has been relatively stable, down from 9.4% in the spring but up from 8.2% last fall, Piper Jaffray said.

Trailing in fourth place is Bose with 3.9%, followed by Sony (NYSE:SNE) (2.6%) and JVC (0.8%), the investment bank said.

The percentage of teens planning to purchase headphones in the next six months increased to 60.4% in the fall survey, up from 56.3% in the spring and 57.6% in fall 2014.

The percentage of teens asking for headphones as gifts was flat at 1.6%, Piper Jaffray reported.

A survey released last week by the Consumer Electronics Association listed headphones and earbuds as the most popular tech items people planned to give this holiday season. Some 28% of respondents to a CEA survey said that they plan to buy headphones as gifts this season, followed by 27% for earbuds.

Other popular tech gift items this season include tablets (26%), portable Bluetooth speakers (25%), notebook or laptop computers (25%) and smartphones (24%).
