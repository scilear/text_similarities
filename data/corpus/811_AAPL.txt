Apple's big new Mac update, El Capitan, doesn't look much different than its previous release Yosemite.

However, there is at least one subtle aesthetic change you may notice — Apple has changed the so-called "spinning wheel of death," as Quartz initially pointed out.

The new wheel, or beach ball as it's also commonly called, now has a flatter look.

It more closely matches the theme Apple has implemented in its new software updates in recent years.

If you've upgraded to El Capitan, there's a chance you haven't noticed this change yet. The beach ball only appears when your Mac is frozen or is taking longer than it should to execute a certain task.

A few users who have seen the new spinning wheel posted images of it on Twitter:

If anyone didn't notice yet - OS X El Capitan has a new beach ball icon (the spinning wheel). Flat and awesome! pic.twitter.com/5dbkYrsmv6 — Nikita Lutsenko (@nlutsenko) June 13, 2015

Now here's what the old wheel looked like. Notice the difference?

In the older wheel, each color is divided into different shades. The new symbol consolidates these colors to make it look a bit more neat.
