Apple rakes in $513 on every sale of its large-screen version of the latest iPhone, retailing for more than three times what it costs to produce.

The large-screen version of Apple's latest phone retails for more than three times what it costs to produce, according to a teardown analysis by research firm IHS.

Apple spends $236 to make each iPhone 6s Plus device, which it sells for over three times that value at $749â€”a 217.4 percent markup that highlights the tech giant's ability to dominate the premium market while other smartphone makers struggle.

The bill for materials for a 16-gigabyte iPhone 6s Plus comes in at $231.50, which rises to $236 once manufacturing costs are added, according to IHS. The iPhone 6s Plus costs just $16 more to make than the last year's model, with Apple benefiting from cheaper components to boost margins.
