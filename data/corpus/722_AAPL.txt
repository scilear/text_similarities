IPhone fans have outdone themselves.

Apple sold 13 million iPhone 6S and 6S Plus smartphones in the last three days, a record for the launch weekend of a new iPhone. Last year, the figure was 10 million.

This time, Apple was able to sell the latest iPhone in China from the get-go, something it couldn’t do last year because of delayed regulatory approval.

This year, most analysts had expected a big number because of lines at Apple stores on Friday and weeks-long shipping delays on online orders. Shares of Apple had risen sharply on Friday in anticipation and barely rose after Apple announced the 13-million figure on Monday. They later fell about 1.5%, to $112.94, a drop similar to the broader Nasdaq index early Monday.

Apple has advertised the iPhone 6S as an upgrade across the board, including with a nicer camera and faster processor. The display can sense the strength of tap, allowing for a new feature to pull up menus and preview information with lighter touches.

IPhones sold after Saturday won’t be included in Apple’s next earnings report, due next month, the company said.
