Global sales of semiconductors reached $27.7 billion in August, down 3% from August 2014, with the steepest decline in Japan, at 13%. Sales in Europe fell 12.4%, reports the Semiconductor Industry Association.

Chip leader Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is set to report earnings after the market close Tuesday. Intel is expected to post a slim 2% year-over-year increase in revenue to $14.2 billion after a 5% decline in Q2.

Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), a leading provider of computer memory chips, reported a 15% decline in revenue when it posted earnings on Oct. 2 for its fiscal Q4 ended Sept. 3. For Q1 2016, Micron guided to $3.35 billion to $3.6 billion in revenue, down 24%.

Declining PC sales are among the challenges facing chip companies. Research firm Gartner last week said PC shipments fell 7.7% year over year in Q3 to 73.7 million units. That's an improvement from a 9.5% decline in Q2, but the Windows 10 operating system that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) launched in Q3 had "minimal impact" on Q3 shipments, Gartner said. Microsoft reports earnings after the market close Oct. 22.

Chip sales in the Americas fell 3.5% in August vs. August 2014, but rose 1.1% from the previous month.

"The global semiconductor market has endured a slight softening of demand in recent months, which has combined with currency devaluation and regular market cyclicality to slow sales somewhat," SIA CEO John Neuffer said in the organization's press release.

Global chip revenue is expected to fall 0.8% to $337.8 billion this year from 2014, Gartner estimates. That would be the first decline since 2012, when sales fell 2.6%, Gartner said.
