CNBC's Phil Han reports from the Frankfurt Motor Show where Mercedes-Benz have just unveiled their vision for an autonomous driving car for the future.

A driverless Apple car modeled on BMW's electric i3 vehicle "may be a nice idea", the automaker's boss told CNBC, after reports earlier this year suggested the U.S. tech giant was looking to make an electric car based on the German firm's design.

German publication Manager Magazin reported in July that Apple was interested in the body design of the i3 as a basis for its own electric car.

But Harald Krüger, the chief executive of BMW, told CNBC that while this "may be a nice idea", he had "no answer" to whether this was going to happen.

"There are always rumours in our business but as you know we are working together with a lot of IT companies like Google, like Apple, to integrate the smartphones into the cars," Krüger told CNBC in an interview at the Frankfurt Motor Show.

"But there is nothing more to add at this moment of time because we definitely look into the future development of the BMW group and digitalization of our business is…I would call it the top trend of our business."
