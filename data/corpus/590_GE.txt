NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- General Electric Co. (GE - Get Report) is said to be in advanced talks with Wells Fargo (WFC) regarding the sale of GE's specialty finance portfolio, which is worth over $30 billion, Reuters reported.

The company is looking to get rid of its financial services units and return to its industrial roots. GE announced back in April that it is looking to sell off its $200 billion GE Capital Financing assets as it looks to focus on manufacturing and producing industrial goods.

So far, Wells Fargo has been outbidding competitors in order to purchase GE's vendor financing, commercial distribution finance and direct lending assets, a source told Reuters.

A deal between Wells Fargo and GE could be announced as early as Wednesday, when Wells Fargo reports its third quarter earnings results, the source added.

Shares of GE are down by 0.32% to $27.98 in pre-market trading on Monday morning.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates GENERAL ELECTRIC CO as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (GE) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, good cash flow from operations, expanding profit margins and solid stock price performance. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat weak growth in earnings per share.
