Materials ETFs tracked higher Tuesday, getting a boost from an 8% spike for chemical giant DuPont (NYSE:DD). Investors digested news that DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman would step down on Oct. 16, even as the company announced plans to curb expenses.

Overall, stock ETFs following the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes failed to extend their recent rally as investors eyed weak trade data and the start of earnings season.

Gold prices rose as the dollar eased vs. the euro, yen and British pound. Meanwhile, iShares Silver Trust (ARCA:SLV), the largest silver ETF, hit a three-month-plus high but closed at the session low. It has surged 5%, 2% and 1% the past three days.

SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (ARCA:DIA) eked out a 0.1% gain on the stock market today, cushioned by gains for DuPont as well as Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, IBD Leaderboard stock Visa (NYSE:V) inched 0.2% lower.

The Dow-tracking ETF, holding 30 industrial leaders, is 8% off its May high.

Materials Select Sector SPDR (ARCA:XLB) popped 1.3% as the materials and energy sectors led the S&P 500 index higher.

XLB holds companies in the chemicals, metals, mining, paper, forest-products, containers, packaging and construction-materials industries. But chemical companies dominate, with a third of its assets, according to Morningstar Inc. Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont, its two largest holdings, alone account for a combined 20% portfolio weighting.

ETFs holding biotech stocks got slammed Tuesday but rallied off their lows. IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (NASDAQ:IBB) tumbled nearly 4%, closing at the midpoint of the day's range.

All of IBB's top 25 holdings took a hit, with Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) tanking 11% on a Q3 revenue miss. The gene-sequencing firm preannounced quarterly results Monday and will report final Q3 numbers on Oct. 20.

IBB's top two holdings, Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), gave up 4% each, while IBD 50 stock Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) fell 3%.

Indonesia, Brazil and Russia topped international ETFs; China and India trailed.
