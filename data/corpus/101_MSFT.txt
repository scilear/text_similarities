Microsoft is out with its Surface Book, Surface Pro 4 and its new Lumia phones, at a product launch event in New York, reports CNBC's Josh Lipton.

Microsoft unveiled Tuesday a new family of phones and devices designed for the Windows 10 operating system at a New York City event.



The Lumia 950 and 950 XL feature an organic LED display that lights up with notifications without the user touching the screen, using close to zero battery life. They also have 32 GB of storage and updated 20-megapixel cameras with image stabilizers and 4K video capabilities.

The Lumia 950, at $549, includes a 5.2-inch display and a hexacore processor, while the larger Lumia 950 XL, at $649, has a 5.7-inch display with an octa-core chip. Both will be available in November, with a third phone, Lumia 550, starting at $139 in December.

The phones debuted alongside several other devices, including 2-in-1 tablet Surface Pro 4, a Surface Book laptop, wearable Microsoft Band, virtual reality device HoloLens and limited-edition Xbox One consoles.
