NEW YORK (AP) -- What's a phone? What's a computer?

The lines blur with Microsoft's new Lumia 950 phones. With an optional dock, you can attack a regular monitor, keyboard and mouse and work with apps on the phone just like you would on a Windows 10 desktop.

Microsoft has struggled with making phones running Windows. Over the summer, the company wrote down the value of Nokia's phone business, which it bought just a year earlier, by $8.4 billion. It also announced 7,800 job cuts in the phone business.

Microsoft is hoping to lure those who use Windows desktops and laptops regularly. The new phones are better at complementing those devices than iPhones and Android phones.

The phones start at $549 and will be available in November.

Earlier Tuesday, the company announced an updated fitness tracker and showed off a HoloLens virtual-reality device.
