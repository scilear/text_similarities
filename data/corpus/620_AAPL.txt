NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Apple (AAPL - Get Report) traded as low as $109.77 into Wednesday's close as some investors were looking for more excitement on the new product front. This weakness provided investors the opportunity to buy the stock at $110.43, which is a key level on technical charts for all of 2015.

Some analysts were more upbeat on Apple's new product features and the stock stabilized on Thursday.

One of the products facing analysts' scrutiny is the new big-screen iPad. So far, most analysts remain upbeat on the performance of the world's most popular company.

This level is based upon my proprietary analytics developed thirty years ago, which are based upon the last nine weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual closes.

As long as closes are above $110.43, the upside potential is for the stock to challenge the 50-day day and 200-day simple moving averages of $118.26 and $121.44. The chart remains in a "death cross" where the 50-day is below the 200-day.

The weekly chart for Apple will shift to positive if the stock closes on Friday above its key weekly moving average, shown in red, at $115.30. Weekly momentum is projected to rise to 34.20 this week up from 27.33 on Sept. 4. Momentum scales run from 00.00 to 100.00, with a reading below 20.00 indicating the stock is oversold and a reading above 80.00 indicating it's overbought. This study is shown in red along the bottom of the chart.

One guideline of technical analysis is that signals from a weekly chart trump what's shown on a daily chart. For Apple, a positive weekly chart enhances the possibility that Apple can rebound to its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages.

Here's how investors should adjust positions following Apple's new product launches.

Investors looking to buy Apple should place a good-till-canceled limit order to purchase the stock if it drops to $110.43, which remains a key level on technical charts until the end of 2015.

Investors looking to reduce holdings should place a good-till-canceled limit order to sell the stock if it rises to the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages of $118.26 and $121.44, respectively.
