A mix of established and new tech companies made up the majority of San Francisco's largest office leases in the third quarter, although it was one of the city's older industries, banking, that had the biggest deal.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) renewed for 200,000 square feet at its regional headquarters at 560 Mission St. in the largest deal of the quarter, according to data from Cushman & Wakefield.

The wearable device maker Fitbit (NYSE: FIT)'s 161,629-square-foot lease at 199 Fremont St. and photo-sharing website Pinterest's 137,446-square-foot lease of the entire 501 Brannan St. were the next largest leases. Tech titans IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) rounded out the top five.

Demand from tech companies has driven up San Francisco's average asking rent to a record high of $66 per square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield, prompting concerns over a bubble.

The vacancy rate dropped to 6 percent in the third quarter, down from 8.3 percent in the third quarter of 2014. However, the amount of space up for sublease climbed for the fourth straight quarter to 954,943 square feet, suggesting that some companies weren't growing as quickly as expected.

Tenants are signing big deals at glass and concrete office towers like 560 Mission St. and One California, but industrial-to-office conversions like TMG Partners' rehabilitation of 1550 Bryant St., the former Hamm's Brewery, have also proven popular for tech companies seeking more character in their offices.
