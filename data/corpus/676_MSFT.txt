Capitol Hill is one of the most popular areas in the Puget Sound region to rent an apartment, and that apartment will cost about $1,500 a month.

But if you want to live next to one of the region's top employers – Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) in Redmond – it will cost you $1,661 a month.

That's according to the most recent data from Dupre + Scott, a Seattle real estate advisory firm.

Apartments next to the region's largest employer, Boeing (NYSE: BA), will cost about $1,200 a month, near both Boeing's Renton 737 facility and Everett's 787 and 777 facilities.

As the region grows and traffic continues to get worse, people are looking to live near where they work. At the same time, the region's political leaders are pushing for greater density in the fast-growing areas to help deal with some traffic and affordable housing issues.
