NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Apple (AAPL - Get Report) was the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday. The stock dropped just over 3% on above-average trade after easily slicing through key support near last week's low. This is a sharp reversal from last Friday's gap-higher open, which lifted the stock back up to its September high.

Tuesday's drop extends Apple's three-day selloff to 6.5% and puts shares on course for more downside. Apple investors will likely see lower entry levels in the near term.

Apple mounted a sharp rebound off the Aug. 24 spike low. By mid-September, the stock had recovered nearly all of the damage from the mid-August flush. This healthy rebound allowed the stock to work off the deeply oversold moving average convergence/divergence level it reached late last month. Unfortunately, this has put the stock in a vulnerable position as it begins to drift lower on accelerating trade. Apple now has its daily MACD working against it.

Last week's high was significant. Apple retested its September peak on Friday and was quickly turned away by a downward-sloping 50-day moving average. The stock will need to fall further while repairing this damage.

Investors should focus on the $105-to-$103 area as this process plays out. Apple's initial 2015 low sits at $104.60. Just below $104 is the stock's September 2014 high as well as the close on Aug. 24. This zone is quite solid and could supply the footing for Apple to build a base strong enough to support a fresh rally.
