Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could stir the M&A froth within the chip sector by edging out Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) to make a play for SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK), B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis theorizes.

SanDisk, a leading maker of flash memory chips for smartphones and other mobile devices, recently made headlines with rumors that the company might put itself on the sales block. Bloomberg reported Micron and Western Digital as the most likely potential suitors.

Milpitas, Calif.-based SanDisk is far from the only chipmaker reportedly up for potential sale. Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is reportedly courting Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM), and Fairchild Semiconductor (NASDAQ:FCS) stock popped nearly 16% Wednesday on news that ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) and Infineon Technologies might be interested in buying the company.

Just ahead of SanDisk's scheduled Q3 earnings report, analyst Ellis suggests that Apple and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) also might bid for SanDisk.

"For Apple, it's a drop in the $115 billion in (its) net-cash-and-investments bucket," Ellis wrote in a research report. It "would pay out surprisingly quickly, given lower-cost Nand (flash) supply and pricing leverage with other memory markers."

Ellis rated SanDisk stock a buy and gave it a price target of 75. SanDisk stock closed Friday at 69.97 after touching a four-month high near 71 on Thursday.

SanDisk Projected For Q3 Fall

SanDisk is slated to post Q3 earnings after the close Wednesday, and the consensus of 35 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for big declines on both the top and bottom lines.

Wall Street models 80 cents EPS on $1.4 billion in revenue, down 45% and 19%, respectively, from Q3 2014. Three months ago, SanDisk guided to $1.35 billion-$1.45 billion in revenue for the quarter.

Despite soft revenue and sales — SanDisk is believed to have lost Apple as a customer for its solid-state drives (SSDs) — the company remains "uniquely compelling" as an acquisition target, Ellis wrote.

SanDisk has a globally recognized brand, its flash offerings are mature, and it has strong enterprise and client SSD market share, Ellis says. Vertical integration would generate "industry-high product gross margins," he wrote.

Merger Faces Toshiba Challenge

Cowen and Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri is more hesitant to put his stamp on the M&A rumors.

Many analysts theorized that Western Digital would be best suited to buy SanDisk, since Western Digital recently received a $3.8 billion infusion from China's Tsinghua Group.

Still, there are questions around SanDisk, Arcuri wrote in a research report.
