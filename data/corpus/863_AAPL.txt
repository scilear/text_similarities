Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6S and 6S+ smartphones went on sale in stores Friday, Sept. 25. The company's stock was down 0.26% for the day as the NASDAQ Composite trended down Friday, closing with a loss of 1%. However, for the week, Apple's stock was up 1.12%.

Apple is on track to exceed sales from its 2014 iPhone release. Industry analysts expect Apple to sell 12 million to 13 million new iPhones over the Sept. 25 weekend. Given expected sales, the iPhone should exceed sales from last year's opening weekend release of 10 million. Apple's new leasing program could be one additional catalyst for sales this year. Through Apple's leasing agreement, customers can now lease the phone in monthly installments with the benefit of upgrading when a new iPhone is available.

For the 2015 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, Apple is expected to have iPhone sales of approximately 230 million. At 230 million, iPhone sales would be up 36% from 2014. At 63% of its total sales, the iPhone product continues to be a main focus for Apple.

In a Sept. 25 CNBC interview, Dan Ives of FBR Capital Markets discussed his thoughts on Apple's Friday iPhone release and the demand for iPhone innovation from consumers.
