The 62-year-old has been in the Volkswagen fold for years, working under the Audi brand from 1977 after studying information technology and toolmaking in his native Germany. At Audi, he headed system analysis, product management and later the Lamborghini product line, before moving to Volkswagen's Wolfsburg headquarters to lead VW's projects department.



At Volkswagen subsidiary Porsche, which he has led since 2010, Mueller is credited with helping deliver record revenue and profit, with deliveries jumping 17 percent in 2014 from a year earlier.

Mueller faces a tough job at the helm. Volkswagen will now try to navigate its way through civil suits and multinational investigations over allegations it deliberately tricked regulators who were testing emissions levels on diesel vehicles made between 2008 and 2015.
