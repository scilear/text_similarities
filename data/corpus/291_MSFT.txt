Microsoft's Windows 10 virtual assistant Cortana is getting even smarter today by integrating LinkedIn. If you're using Windows Mail and Calendar for meetings, you can now connect Cortana to your LinkedIn account, which will surface details about the people you're meeting with in Cortana's reminders. That includes information like photos (helpful if you're not good with faces), job titles and a quick link to their entire LinkedIn profile. Naturally, you'll also be able to send a LinkedIn request right from Cortana reminders. This is the sort of integration mobile mail and calendar apps have been including for years now, so it's not exactly new, but it'll still be useful for Windows 10 users. And it's also a fitting example of how third-party companies can tap into Cortana.
