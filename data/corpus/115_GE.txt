General Electric Co. promoted an executive in its power business, Vic Abate, to chief technology officer, the latest in a series of leadership changes under Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt.

The position, responsible for research and development, will address “high-tech infrastructure challenges,” Abate, 51, said in a telephone interview Thursday. He will oversee about 50,000 engineers and nine science centers after replacing Mark Little, who is retiring after 37 years at the company.

Immelt is looking to expand GE’s technology operations and incorporate analytics into the jet engines, gas turbines and other industrial machinery it sells. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company last week formed a new division, GE Digital, to oversee software and data operations.

Abate, who will move into the role at the end of the year, said analytics will be integral as he oversees the development of technology across GE’s business lines. “When you make those connections right, you can make products faster, you can help your customers be more competitive,” he said.

GE has announced several high-level personnel shifts in recent weeks, including Beth Comstock’s promotion to vice chair. The company also changed its chief marketing officer, chief information officer and CEO of the transportation division. Joe Mastrangelo, who heads power conversion operations, will succeed Abate as CEO of power generation, GE said.
