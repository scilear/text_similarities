Microsoft Corp.’s former chief executive, Steve Ballmer, said on Friday that he owns 4% of Twitter Inc., a surprise revelation that makes him one of the social media company’s top investors.

Ballmer, now the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, tweeted on Friday that he accumulated the stake in the past few months. He confirmed his Twitter investment to The Wall Street Journal. It isn’t clear whether he bought the shares after Dick Costolo stepped down as CEO in July.

Good job @twitter,@twittermoments innovation, @jack Ceo, leaner, more focused. Glad I bought 4% past few months. Like @alwaleedbinT move too — Steve Ballmer (@Steven_Ballmer) October 16, 2015

In the tweet, he called Twitter TWTR, -0.51% “leaner” and “more focused” with the recent appointment of CEO Jack Dorsey and the release of a news-curation product called Moments.

Ballmer’s stake would make him the third largest individual owner of Twitter stock -- behind co-founder Ev Williams, who held about 6.9% as of August, according to a regulatory filing, and Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, who, along with his investment firm Kingdom Holding, owns more than 5% as of October. Dorsey holds about a 3% stake in Twitter.

A Twitter spokesman declined to comment.
