NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC - Get Report) shares are declining 1% to $51.34 in early morning trading on Wednesday despite the bank releasing its third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings results that beat analysts' estimates.

In the latest quarter, the company earned $1.05 a share, beating analysts estimates of $1.04 a share.

Revenue came in at $21.88 billion, also beating analysts' estimates of $21.76 billion.

In the same period the year before, the company earned $1.02 a share on revenue of $21.21 billion.

"Wells Fargo's strong third quarter results reflected the ability of our diversified business model to generate consistent financial performance in an uneven economic environment while continuing to meet our customers' financial needs," CEO John Stumpf stated.

Financial data for the recent period was helped by acquiring General Electric's (GE) assets and businesses, including its finance arm.

Last month, the San Francisco-based bank also said that it plans to acquire most of GE's railcar and locomotive leasing unit.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates WELLS FARGO & CO as a Buy with a ratings score of A-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate WELLS FARGO & CO (WFC) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, growth in earnings per share, increase in stock price during the past year, good cash flow from operations and expanding profit margins. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.
