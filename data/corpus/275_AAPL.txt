Microsoftâ€™s Surface Book has people talking and quite possibly, has Apple on its toes.

Microsoft's Surface devices have been on the scene awhile, but the tech giant is making waves with its new laptop-tablet hybrid.

Microsoft unveiled the Surface Book at a New York City event on Tuesday, showing the world a $1,499 device that can be used as either a laptop or tablet. Wired magazine called the device the "ultimate hybrid PC" and "the most compelling device the company has ever made."

It's also Microsoft's first-ever laptop.

It's more expensive than Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro with retina display, and it's also slightly lighter. The Surface Book weighs 3.34 pounds with the keyboard attached, according to Microsoft. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with retina display costs $1,299 and weighs 3.48 pounds, according to Apple.
