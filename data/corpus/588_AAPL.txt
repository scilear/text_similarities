NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is bouncing back on Wednesday, up 1.4%.



However, the CNBC "Fast Money Halftime" traders weren't so quick to jump on board. This "very well could be" the next bear market, said Josh Brown, CEO and co-founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management. There's just no way sure-fire way to know. From top to bottom, the market has fallen 12.5%, but the decline could extend to down 20% without it being the end of the world, he added.

While the September to mid-October period commonly tends to be a rough ride for investors, it's not uncommon to see the market bottom in October either, Brown said. That very well could happen and lead to a rally.

Pete Najarian, co-founder of optionmonster.com and trademonster.com, agreed that it's really tough to know whether the market is going up or down. So much of its movement recently has been tied to the Federal Reserve and its stance on interest rates. He believes the Fed will raise rates before the end of the year, and therefore financial stocks look attractive.

Big selloffs create good buying opportunities for long-term investors, said Jon Najarian, co-founder of optionmonster.com and trademonster.com. Specifically, he likes technology and consumer discretionary stocks, like Amazon (AMZN - Get Report) and Best Buy (BBY - Get Report) .

The conversation turned to Carl Icahn and the hedge fund heavyweight's recent video explaining why he's cautious on the overall market.

Speaking on the show, Icahn explained that average American investors are the ones who are most at risk, because many of them are buying dangerous securities. Specifically, he has a lot of concern about the high-yield bond market, which he said the high is overpriced and suffers from a lack of liquidity. The risk simply isn't worth the reward, and there are several companies that won't be able to pay back their loans.
