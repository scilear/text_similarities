NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Internet infrastructure company Equinix (EQIX - Get Report) are on fire, and CEO Steve Smith couldn't be more bullish.

"We're very fortunate that the purpose of our business is to help companies get in the middle of the greatest trends in the history of technology," he said. "We're in the middle of the cloud computing paradigm shift and we're assisting companies moving towards this Internet of Things shift" -- the growing trend of connecting physical objects to the Internet.

The stock is up about 17% since the start of the year, strongly outpacing the 1.6% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

Equinix works with some major names. "We deal with the Verizons (VZ - Get Report) and AT&Ts (T - Get Report) of the world, along with the British Telecoms and the Deutsche Telecoms," Smith said. 'We deal with all of the biggest tech companies like Google (GOOGL - Get Report) and Microsoft (MSFT - Get Report) ."

Smith said over the next few years, the company will focus on helping enterprises unlock value in the cloud computing space. "We're talking about big pharmaceutical companies, health care companies, big travel and transportation companies, plus oil and gas," he added. "We call these enterprise companies."

In 17 years, the company has accumulated an impressive base of over 6,000 customers, but growth could soon soar. "If we do this right over the next decade, we could have 20,000 to 50,000 customers," he said.

Meanwhile, the second quarter marked Redwood City, Calif.-based Equinix's 50th quarter in a row of revenue growth, posting a 10% increase in sales. The company reports third quarter earnings on Oct. 28.

"We've told the market that we're going to grow the company 15% this year in terms of revenue," he added. "I feel good that we will stay on track with that commitment to the market."
