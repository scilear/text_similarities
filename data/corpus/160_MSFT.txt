Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) chip suppliers Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) and Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) got split ratings Thursday, while leading biotech Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) was upgraded.

Qorvo, which supplies chips to the Apple iPhone, saw its shares close down 3.15% on the stock market today after it was initiated at neutral by Citigroup. Last week, the new Apple iPhone hit store shelves, with Apple selling more than 13 million iPhone 6S handsets in the opening weekend.
