"I think there's reason for optimism, but at the same time, I think there are plenty of reasons to be cautious," Frederick said, adding that an increase in interest rates would be an "upside catalyst" for markets at the end of the year.

Crude oil prices rose to around $49 per barrel as Syria tensions escalated, countering further signs of an economic slowdown in Asia and rising U.S. inventories.
