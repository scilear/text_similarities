Volkswagen AG’s emissions scandal may trigger a separate investigation in Sweden.

The Swedish Prosecution Authority’s National Anti-Corruption Unit is evaluating whether to start a probe into Volkswagen after the German carmaker admitted it cheated on emissions tests in some of its diesel cars.

It will start by evaluating whether an investigation can be conducted under Swedish jurisdiction, Alf Johansson, a chief prosecutor at the corruption unit, said in an e-mailed response to questions on Tuesday.

"A case was initiated by the unit head on Friday and was put on my table," Johansson said. "I have not yet decided if an investigation will be started. Whether the case will remain at the corruption unit after my evaluation is also one of the questions I’m looking at."

Sweden’s evaluation of a potential investigation into Volkswagen follows a revelation by Europe’s biggest car manufacturer that it used software to obfuscate how much its diesel-engine cars pollute. It triggered the resignation of the carmaker’s Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn; he has since been replaced by Matthias Mueller. VW’s market value has plunged 27 billion euros ($30.4 billion) since the scandal was revealed.
