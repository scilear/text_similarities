NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Jefferies upgraded NVIDIA (NVDA - Get Report) to "buy" from "hold" on Thursday, raising its price target for the chipmaker $30 from $23.

Shares of NVIDIA were gaining 1.8% to $23.52 in pre-market trading.

The analyst firm raised its fiscal 2016 EPS estimates for the chipmaker to 79 cents a share from 76 a share. Jefferies lowered its fiscal 2017 EPS estimates for NVIDIA to $1.36 a share from $1.37 a share.

Jefferies analysts said that two-thirds of NVIDIA's long term revenue is exposed to secular growth trends in PC gaming, connected cars, and accelerated cloud computing.

"Near term, we think NVDA benefits from a PC restock, and view it as an option on the nascent Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) market, with the potential for P/E expansion as Oculus FB, HTC and Microsoft (MSFT - Get Report) ship products starting in 1Q16," the analysts wrote.

TheStreet Ratings team rates NVIDIA CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate NVIDIA CORP (NVDA) a BUY. This is driven by a few notable strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, good cash flow from operations, solid stock price performance and expanding profit margins. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income."
