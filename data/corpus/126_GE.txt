Bloomberg Freeport-McMoRan, a copper miner, is expected by analysts to record the largest decline of sales per share this quarter for any S&P 500 industrial or material company.

The ouster of DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman shows just how important it is for industrial conglomerates to get their houses in order and create shareholder value. Other chief executives may be in the hot seat when companies start to report third-quarter earnings Thursday, led by Alcoa AA, -0.22%

Kullman had defeated an effort by Trian Fund Management LP, the activist investor group led by Nelson Peltz, to gain seats on DuPont’s DD, +3.33% board of directors in May.

But by the time of the Kullman news Monday, DuPont’s stock already was down 25% this year. The company moved so fast, it didn’t have enough time to find a permanent successor. (Edward Breen, a member of the company’s board and the chairman of Tyco International PLC TYC, +3.02% was named interim CEO.)

Other companies may have to follow DuPont’s lead and slim down. General Electric Co. GE, +2.53% the iconic U.S. conglomerate founded in 1892, is unloading its once-massive finance unit, among others. It, too, is a target of Trian.

DuPont completed the spinoff of performance-chemicals division Chemours Co. CC, +1.44% in July. The company’s third-quarter sales for its remaining units are expected to show major declines, according to estimates among analysts polled by FactSet:

DuPont product segment Estimated sales - third quarter, 2015 ($mil) Sales - third quarter, 2014 Expected sales decline Nutrition and Health $899 $862 -4% Performance Materials $1,552 $1,419 -9% Agriculture $1,563 $1,297 -21% Industrial Biosciences $318 $311 -2% Safety and Protection $977 $928 -5% Electronics and Communications $623 $565 -10% Source: FactSet

DuPont’s stock rose as much as 13% on Monday after the company announced the 59-year-old Kullman’s “retirement.” DuPont, at the same time, lowered its 2015 operating-earnings estimate to roughly $2.75 a share from $3.10.

What cheered investors was the acceleration of a cost-cutting plan by one year. DuPont expects to lower its annual expense run rate by $1.3 billon by the end of 2016, with annual savings rising to $1.6 billion by the end of 2017.

Earnings season

The rising dollar, slowing economic growth in China and a decline in commodities prices are adding to what looks like a rather bleak quarter for the S&P 500 SPX, +1.66% industrial and materials sectors.

Analysts polled by S&P Capital IQ expect industrial companies to post third-quarter earnings per share growth of only 1.03% from a year earlier, slightly better than in the previous three months. For the materials sector, which includes DuPont, EPS is expected to decline by 13%, the biggest drop in three years, according to S&P Capital IQ analyst Lindsey Bell.

Any company can suffer a bad quarter because of charges related to acquisitions, restructuring or other one-time items. So today we’re focusing on sales growth, often the main driver of a stock’s performance. To factor in any dilution from the issuance of shares, or the reduction in share count from repurchases, we’re looking at expected growth of sales per share.

Sales per share is a most useful measure. If a company issued shares to raise money for an acquisition, rising sales per share can help shed light on whether the deal was worthwhile for you.
