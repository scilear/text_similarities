NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The release of a new iPhone might not elicit the overnight waiting-in-line crowds like it used to, as this will mark the ninth straight year that Apple (AAPL - Get Report) has put a new iPhone on the shelves.

Still, no tech company is better at drumming up enthusiasm for its "next big thing" like Apple. The company announced earlier this month that pre-orders were on pace to surpass 10 million. A look at Apple's U.S. and Chinese Web sites show all the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models are sold out ahead of the Sept. 25 launch.

Website iFixit, which has a history of tearing down the phones to see what's inside,revealed the new iPhone 6s has a slightly smaller battery than last years' model.

For better or worse, consumers care about Apple devices more than anything that has the name Microsoft (MSFT - Get Report) , Samsung (SSNLF) or Google (GOOGL - Get Report) (GOOG - Get Report) on it. Which is why people will still get up early to be at their local Apple store on Friday when the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus become available to the masses.

With that in mind, here's a look at some things you should know as you decide if the new iPhones are for you.

1. The phones will be available.

Apple says the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be on the shelves and available for "walk-in customers" at its retail stores around the U.S. and in 10 other countries at 8 a.m. local time. This, of course, will be dependent upon demand, and Apple encourages customers to arrive early.

Of course, you could have pre-ordered a new iPhone starting on Sept. 12, too.
