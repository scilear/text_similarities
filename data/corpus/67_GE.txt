Special Report: Mutual Fund Strategies

Volatility in the stock market might send some investors scurrying for cover. But those who favor dividends are probably less likely to panic. If selected carefully, dividend stocks can offer the best of both worlds: stock-price performance and a steady payout.

So dividend funds can be key components of long-term mutual fund investing.

Here are some of the top stocks — by those two measures — held by leading mutual funds, based on their 10-year annualized return.

SunAmerica Focused Dividend Strategy led with a 11.18% average annual return for the period. The fund has $8.8 billion in assets under management.

Many of its top holdings are classic dividend plays such as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). One of its big stakes at the end of June was Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI), which not only pays hefty dividends but has also performed well this year.

Shares of the tobacco company have rallied more than 40% this year, while the S&P 500 remains underwater. The Camel and Pall Mall cigarette maker pays a quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share, or $1.44 annualized, which works out to a 3.2% yield. The S&P 500's average payout is 2.1%.

SunAmerica also held shares of Altria Group (NYSE:MO). The Marlboro maker in August raised its quarterly dividend by 8.7% to 56.5 cents a share. That works out to an annualized yield of 4.1%. Shares are up 15% this year.

Another big holding, AT&T (NYSE:T), tops IBD's Dividend Leaders list with a 5.9% annualized payout. But the stock, down 1% this year, has been a laggard.

Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) offers a dividend yield of 3.3% on an annual basis. The defense contractor and F-35 fighter-jet maker's stock price has appreciated 11% this year, beating the broader market.

Sit Dividend Growth , with $1.1 billion under management, produced a 10-year average annual return of 9.05%. Its top holding based on percentage of assets was Medtronic (NYSE:MDT).

Shares are up 1% for the year. The medical-device maker is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised their dividend payout for at least the past 25 consecutive years. Its annualized yield is 2.4%.

Vanguard Dividend Growth came in a 9.16% return. It manages $24 billion in assets. Lockheed is among its biggest positions. Dividend aristocrats Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also make its top holdings. Their annualized yields are 2%, 3.3% and 3.2%, respectively. But like the S&P 500, all are in the red for the year.
