Target Corp. will become the biggest retailer to offer the Apple Watch, throwing support behind a device that’s fighting for mainstream acceptance this holiday season.

The Apple Inc. product will debut in some Target stores this week, before reaching all of its locations by Oct. 25, the Minneapolis-based retailer said on Friday. The Apple Watch will go on sale at Target’s website on Oct. 18.

Target’s move follows the rollout of the Apple Watch at Best Buy Co. in August. That chain has said that demand for the device outstripped its expectations. After initially being offered in 100 Best Buy locations, the company brought the Apple Watch to all of its 1,047 U.S. stores.

Target may be a bigger test of the Apple Watch’s appeal. Unlike Best Buy, it’s a discount retailer that isn’t focused on electronics. The chain has about 1,800 stores in the U.S. and could be a key proving ground for Apple as it tries to show that the product, which costs $349 to $599, is more than a niche gadget.

Target customers will be able to choose from 20 Apple Watch models in 38 millimeter and 42 millimeter sizes.
