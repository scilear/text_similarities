Hello! We hope you're not sick of big keynotes, because Microsoft is about to kick off a press event in New York, and if that invite up there is any indication, some shiny new hardware is in order. If nothing else, we can safely assume that includes the long-awaited Surface Pro 4 -- it is their flagship product, after all, and the last-gen version has gone a year and a half without an update. Microsoft is also likely to officially introduce Windows 10 Mobile alongside some new smartphones, including the 5.2-inch Lumia 950 and the 5.7-inch 950 XL. We also wouldn't be surprised if we got a close-up peek at the lower-end Lumia 550, which has also been revealed in leaks. And hey, if we're lucky maybe we'll even learn more about when HoloLens is finally going on sale.
