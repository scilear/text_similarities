Stocks took short but uncertain steps Friday afternoon as the major indexes headed toward a second straight up week. The Nasdaq stepped up 0.3%, while the S&P 500 stepped down less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both main exchanges.

A key support line was retaken Friday morning but in a half-a-loaf fashion. The Nasdaq climbed above its 10-week moving average and just above the 50-day line.

About 17 points separate the two lines, perhaps reflecting intraweek volatility. The S&P 500 is holding above both its 50-day and 10-week lines.

Among blue chips, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of the day's better performers in the Dow. Apple rose 2% in roughly average volume. The stock is 17% off its high. A report Thursday from research firm Gartner said that Apple was gaining market share in the personal computer market.

Meanwhile, three top-rated stocks took stabs at breakouts without complete success.

Helen of Troy (NASDAQ:HELE) — whose brands include Revlon, Vicks and Dr. Scholl's — surged as much as 10% in huge volume. The stock cleared a 100.43 buy point in a cup base but then retreated just below the entry.

Gift-card provider Blackhawk Network (NASDAQ:HAWK) cleared a 46.23 buy point in strong volume but then retreated under the entry.

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coasted above a 59.06 buy point Monday and has spent the whole week waiting for big volume that has yet to come. The stock is only 1% above the entry, which means that it still has a chance to deliver the goods.
