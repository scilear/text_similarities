NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management announced a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric (GE - Get Report) earlier today, making it the firm's largest position and sending GE's stock surging more than 5%. Peltz believes GE "is undervalued and under-appreciated by the market" and thinks shares could reach as much as $45 by the end of 2017 compared to the $27 price today. Although Trian's investment thesis is difficult to ascertain, there were compelling reasons to add GE to the Top 20 Dividend Stocks list in June. Consider the following strengths.

GE is one of the most unloved blue chip stocks. Almost anywhere you read a GE article on the internet, commentators are quick to rip into CEO Jeff Immelt, the company's poor capital allocation decisions, the dividend cut during the financial crisis, the bureaucracy, the lack of capital returned to shareholders, the company's deceptive PR efforts, and more.

And why not? There is plenty to be frustrated about if you are or were a long-term GE shareholder. Since Immelt assumed the role of CEO from Welch in 2001, GE's total shareholder return (including dividends) is a whopping 0%. Without dividends, the stock is down more than 35% compared to the near doubling of the rest of the industrial sector.

As seen below, GE's total shareholder return ("TSR") has trailed the market just about every year since 2000 (represented by a falling line). The financial crisis dealt the company a huge blow in 2008, but the stock has actually performed more in line with the market since then, compounding at a respectable 14.4% annualized rate from 2010-2014.
