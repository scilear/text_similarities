Microsoft has completely remade its Surface 4 Pro Type Cover, adding better type feel, a fingerprint sensor, a larger trackpad and more. For starters, the company gave its Surface Pro 3 users some love by making the new keyboard compatible with the older model. It's also the thinnest and lightest yet, and since the Surface Pro 4 itself shrunk from 9.1 to 8.4mm, the whole package is much smaller. The keys are also quieter, have more space between them and a better feel, which may finally make it a viable option for folks who couldn't handle the Surface Pro 3's slightly mushy keyboard.

As for the trackpad, Microsoft said its "highest precision glass trackpad" ever is 40 percent larger than the last model and features five-point multitouch. There's also an optional fingerprint sensor that will only be available in the US. Along with the improvements in the Surface Pro 4 itself, it all sounds pretty nice for $130 (available in six colors), but we'll make the final call when we can try it for ourselves. Pre-orders for the Surface Pro 4 are now open and it will start shipping on October 26th.
