Target just became a bigger threat to Best Buy.

The retailer will begin selling Apple Watches online October 18 and in stores October 25.

The Apple watch will be sold at 1,800 Target stores. Best Buy has just over 1,000 locations.

Best Buy was the first retail chain to sell the device besides the Apple Store.

The device has proved popular.

Best Buy reported a rise in domestic comparable sales of 3.8% for the second quarter and posted a better-than expected-profit, according to Fortune.

Target will offer 20 models of the watch priced at $349 and $599. More watches will be available at Target online â€” including the Apple Watch Sport.

Target already has a vast electronics department, offering televisions, cameras, tablets, cell phones, headphones, and navigation systems in stores.

Target also sells wearable devices like the Fitbit, smart watches and GoPros.
