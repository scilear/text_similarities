If you're thinking about ditching your iPhone for Android, you might want to consider this deal from Samsung.

The company just announced that it will pay the monthly installment bill for your new phone until 2016.

The discount applies if you buy a Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, or Galaxy S6 Edge Plus on an installment plan from T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, or US Cellular. You won't be eligible for the discount if you buy a new phone on AT&T's network, however.

If you buy a Galaxy S6 through Verizon's installment option, you'd typically have to pay $24 per month for 24 months to fully pay off the device. Now, Samsung is saying it will take care of those monthly payments until 2016 if you buy a new Galaxy phone between now and Oct. 9. The rebate caps at $120.

And, if you're switching from the iPhone, Samsung says it'll also throw in a $100 Google Play gift card. The announcement comes just after Apple's new iPhone 6S officially launched in stores.

This is one of several attempts from Samsung to get customers to switch from the iPhone to its Galaxy phones. The company recently released a TV spot for its new phones that highlight all of the things they can do that the iPhone can't.
