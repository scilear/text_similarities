NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Preorder supplies of Microsoft's (MSFT - Get Report) Surface Book, it's first laptop ever, has sold on out on the company's online store, MarketWatch reports.

Earlier this month, the technology company first introduced its 13.5 inch laptop which comes with a detachable keyboard and that can be turned into a tablet.

All versions of the Surface Book, which ranges in price from $1,499 to $2,099, are currently out of stock, the company said.

"We will have limited quantities of Surface Book available in store on October 26 and will be updating online availability with new product ship dates soon."

Even though Microsoft's new laptop has sold out quickly, analyst Jan Dawson at Jackdaw Research said it's hard to know if that's due to an overwhelming demand or underwhelming supply, according to MarketWatch.

Microsoft shares are lower by 0.38% to $46.72 on Wednesday.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates MICROSOFT CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate MICROSOFT CORP (MSFT) a BUY. This is driven by a few notable strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its reasonable valuation levels, expanding profit margins, increase in stock price during the past year, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.
