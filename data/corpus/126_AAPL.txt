Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) had their price targets increased Thursday, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was upgraded, and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) was downgraded.

Analysts at Needham raised their price target on Netflix to 125 from 111, despite the Internet TV service missing Q3 earnings and sales views late Wednesday and falling short of its own U.S. subscriber-growth goal.

Piper Jaffray lifted its price target on Netflix to 109 from 96, and Oppenheimer upped its target to 130 from 125. Baird raised its target to 128 from 120. But Credit Suisse cut its target to 124 from 130, and Raymond James trimmed its own to 130 from 140.

Netflix shares closed down 8.3% to 101.09 on the stock market today, its worst drop since Oct. 16, 2014, the day after Netflix's Q3 2014 report.

Nike climbed 2.3% to 128.79, hitting a new high, after its price target was raised to 137 from 136 by Telsey Advisory Group, which kept its outperform rating on the stock. FBR Capital upped its target to 126 from 120.

During an investor day Wednesday, the athletic-apparel maker set a $50 billion revenue goal by 2020.

Facebook's stock price rose 2% after it was upgraded to buy and was given a price target of 115 at Argus Research, which cited Facebook's transition to mobile and potential for more advertising share.

Late Wednesday, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was initiated with an overweight rating by Barclays and given a 150 price target, which is below most recent price targets from other other analysts.

Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Apple might face up to $862 million in damages after a jury found that the iPhone maker used technology owned by the University of Wisconsin-Madison's licensing arm without permission in chips found in many of its most popular devices.

Apple shares rose 1.5% Thursday.

Wal-Mart lost 1.2% after it was downgraded to neutral by both Credit Suisse and Bank of America, which provided price targets of 62 and 65, respectively.

On Wednesday Wal-Mart shares sank 10% to 60.03 — their lowest point in more than three years — as the world's biggest retailerwarned of weak sales and falling profit amid wage hikes, e-commerce investment and price cuts.

Internet-based banking firm BofI Holding (NASDAQ:BOFI) was upgraded to buy from neutral by D.A. Davidson a day after its stock sank 30% on news that it is being sued by a former internal auditor who raised questions over its business practices. BofI shares rallied more than 19% Thursday.

Deere (NYSE:DE) fell 0.1% after it was initiated at market outperform by Avondale Partners.
